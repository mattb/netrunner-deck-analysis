If you want to have fun with quirky shenanigans, this isn't for you. Astrobiotics is a quintessential Spike deck. My opponents have left once they see what I'm doing, they've flamed how much of a bore it is, and I've scared away a couple of new players (sorry! I do always put [Adv] in my OCTGN room :\/). This deck has an extremely hard time losing.<\/p>\n\n<p>I've spent months analyzing TWIY trying to figure out how to unlock its true potential. Many conclusions I've drawn won't be new to many (Biotic Laboring a Astroscript is teh shit), but many I haven't seen reflected as much as I think should. Anyways, let's begin.<\/p>\n\n<p>Firstly, I'm going to make a bold claim: TWIY improves as the deck approaches 40 cards. TWIY is all about consistency and speed - the more you fine-tune both, the better your deck becomes (even if only marginally - it adds up). There's nothing worse than spending half your game drawing without seeing an Astroscript or fast advance tool<\/p>\n\n<p>Now, as many of you are aware, cutting to 40 cards increases your agenda density and you lack the deckspace needed to incorporate ice, econ, and the tools you need, causing some opening hands to lose the game for you. Anonymous Tip was designed for TWIY. Running three of them, you have a 40% chance of starting with one, granting you an eight-card starting hand. Anonymous Tip provides opening flexibility - its deckslot functions not only as a draw accelerator, but also as either ice or economy since it gives you a second opportunity in a bad opening hand. This Andromeda-like effect all but eliminated bad openings in this deck (too bad it doesn't come with an improved mulligan).<\/p>\n\n<p>So what constitutes a good opening hand? Here are cards to mulligan for (in order):<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Biotic Labor<\/li>\n<li>Astroscript Pilot Program<\/li>\n<li>Ice #1<\/li>\n<li>Anonymous Tip<\/li>\n<li>Econ #1<\/li>\n<li>Ice #2<\/li>\n<li>SanSan City Grid (moves up vs Gabe)<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>Your one and only objective is to get that Astrochain rollin'. If you have a Beale in HQ and don't suspect Siphon, leave it undefended. If that Beale is an Astroscript, protect it (I swear, the fact tihs deck exists angers the Gods of luck). Biotic Labor is the most sure-fire way to score your first Astroscript (and allows an alternate scoring method if your Astros get stolen), at only 5c if you use SfSS (which is also helpful against denial decks such as Reina or Gabe). I would not recommend switching SfSS for Subliminal Messaging or Restructure, as it greatly increasses your scoring window - something that I think has been undervalued.<\/p>\n\n<p>And that's right, no Jackson. Every time he showed in an opening hand, I was disappointed. I'll consider re-adding him if Noise gets the help he needs (never thought I'd be saying that). Data Raven is here because TWIY Scorch decks put the fear of God into runners, so they either never run that server again, find methods of bypassing it, or they run much more slowly and remove the tags. Very rarely have I encountered a runner willing to eat the tags without digging for a Plascrete first. I do however, intend to switch it for the spoiled Sentry ETR that can't be bypassed, and swapping Enigmas for Quandry.<\/p>\n\n<p>This deck, if piloted properly without the worst possible draws, keeps the runner at phase two of the game (ice is out, but runner is still searching for breakers). My average game length is 8-11 turns, with about 10 cards left in R&amp;D. Good luck with it!<\/p>\n","username":"Lysander","cards":{"01059":2,"01064":2,"01081":3,"01082":2,"01083":3,"01088":2,"01092":3,"01101":1,"01110":3,"01111":3,"02060":2,"02114":1,"02115":3,"04034":2,"04039":2,"04076":3,"04095":1,"04096":3}},{"id":2958,"name":"Simple Jin","creation":"2014-03-08 13:49:00","description":"<p>Playing Jinteki with less mind games as compared to normal.

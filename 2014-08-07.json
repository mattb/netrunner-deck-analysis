This is possible due to paintbrush, which will trade clicks to make more efficient runs.  The best icebreaker for this is Gordian Blade--it's in-faction, keeps strength for the entire run, and is relatively cheap to get up and running.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Having made this decision (foolishly?) the rest of the deck is based around having a lot of other possibilities for getting programs (both tutoring through Self-Modifying Code and Test Run, and recursion through Clone Chips and Ar Levy Access).  This does a few things: first, it allows you to run only one  copy of Gordian Blade, since it effectively has 7x copies when searching for it the first time, and four copies that the corp must trash to stall you out--something that will be difficult to do since you will not face-check anything you can't break thanks to paintbrush.  Similarly, the two copies of Replicator make this deck FAR smaller than it appears, since you can go and get the second copy of anything you want after it's installed, making it a smaller deck than it appears.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Having provided a way to both get and retain the two crucial tools--Gordian Blade + Paintbrush--the deck has two other main supports: 1) making runs cheaper, and 2) making runs more profitable.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Making runs cheaper is seen through the obvious: two data suckers and 3x personal touches.  Each of these provides huge dividends over the course of the game.  Similarly, the choice to run The Toolbox also gives clickless, recurring credits to fuel the one large run each turn, given even if the corp somehow gets 3x thick, non-code gate ice.  To help facilitate this <em>not<\/em> happening, hold Escher in your hand to re-arrange ice where ever needed--this is huge as it can save you multiple clicks per turn. <\/p>\n\n<p>Pressure comes through HQ Interface (looking at 4x cards per is awesome), Indexing, R&amp;D Interface, and Keyhole.  These combined together provide pressure to both HQ and RnD, giving two very easy ways to provide pressure and keep the Corp from defending the remote servers too heavily, allowing for easier snipes.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Economy comes from the obvious: clickless econ from daily casts, the awesome kati, and the no brainer Sure Gamble. The additional econ comes from Professional Contacts if you need to dig deep, otherwise card draw + econ comes from Motivation + Oracle May, or Post-Test Run + Oracle May--getting a card + 2 credits is huge. <\/p>\n\n<p>This deck hates being tagged, so be careful of that. It may need some plascretes or something else thrown in, but you should be rich enough to beat traces if you play this right--remember, most runs will be free! <\/p>\n","username":"jared.saltz","cards":{"01008":2,"01040":3,"01041":2,"01043":1,"01044":1,"01050":3,"02046":1,"02047":3,"02049":1,"02085":3,"02088":2,"02091":2,"02106":2,"02107":3,"03031":2,"03035":1,"03038":3,"03046":3,"03049":2,"03053":3,"04008":2,"04061":1,"04108":2,"05054":2,"06019":1}},{"id":8348,"name":"Weyland Pay to Win 2.0","creation":"2014-08-07 12:12:55","description":"<p>Continuing the long tradition of Pay To Win Weyland, I've updated the list to include lotus field to combat datasucker users.

He also needs that money to be ready anytime and fast.\n5) he usually can't beat a trace, so resources are sketchy in general. Relying on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.netrunnerdb.com\/en\/card\/02091\">Kati Jones<\/a> for late game resources is like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.netrunnerdb.com\/en\/card\/05047\">pushing your luck<\/a> imo. But Kati is a good option for Nasir.<\/p>\n\n<p>This deck aims to satisfy most of these. The only problem I have ignored in this is ICE destruction, which I find to be inessential if you're going Anarch suite + Atman at 4 + <a href=\"http:\/\/www.netrunnerdb.com\/en\/card\/01044\">Opus<\/a>. I've opted for Modded which can help install some of the 15 cards available, some of which you might need in a pinch. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.netrunnerdb.com\/en\/card\/01019\">Easy Mark<\/a> solves one of his other problems: starting a turn with no cred. I don't like taking brain damage via <a href=\"http:\/\/www.netrunnerdb.com\/en\/card\/01004\">Stimhack<\/a>, and Easy Mark is the substitution. It also brings you up to 3 cred from 0, which is what nearly every breaker in the deck costs.<\/p>\n\n<p>I've been using Armitage Codebusting in every Nasir build, and it's been excellent. Armitage is a pre-Opus Opus so you can get the necessary stuff out. I've never NOT wanted it. I am not a fan of Kati with Nasir because she's far too slow, and you can Test Run\/SMC Opus.<\/p>\n\n<p>Some card choices: <\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.netrunnerdb.com\/en\/card\/01038\">Akamatsu<\/a> over <a href=\"http:\/\/www.netrunnerdb.com\/en\/card\/04086\">Solutions<\/a>. It's cheaper, and you'll build your rig slowly, not all at once (because no <a href=\"http:\/\/www.netrunnerdb.com\/en\/card\/01004\">Stimhack<\/a>). <\/p>\n\n<p>Quality Time over Diesel. Generally, if I'm drawing, I'm digging for a solution or I am trying to avoid taking a lot of net damage.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.netrunnerdb.com\/en\/card\/01007\">Corroder<\/a> over Inti. Inti is the 46th card. I like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.netrunnerdb.com\/en\/card\/03048\">Inti<\/a>, but couldn't justify keeping it in when I have the best barrier breaker in the game already. And most of the barrier ICE you'll facecheck can be broken with Corroder anyway. <\/p>\n\n<p>No <a href=\"http:\/\/www.netrunnerdb.com\/en\/card\/03034\">Scavenge<\/a>. This was my last cut from the deck to free room for <a href=\"http:\/\/www.netrunnerdb.com\/en\/card\/03038\">Clone Chip<\/a>. Clone Chip just does so much more for this deck. Recurring Imps is huge, and it allows me to do so during a run. I won't have a way to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.netrunnerdb.com\/en\/card\/03034\">Scavenge<\/a> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.netrunnerdb.com\/en\/card\/01026\">Femme<\/a>, but I can always trash it and then Test Run it, if it comes down to that.<\/p>\n\n<p>Just 1 <a href=\"http:\/\/www.netrunnerdb.com\/en\/card\/03040\">Atman<\/a>. Atman is usually going to go at 4 unless you know what you're playing against.<\/p>\n\n<p>No <a href=\"http:\/\/www.netrunnerdb.com\/en\/card\/01012\">Parasite<\/a>. I find that I need my <a href=\"http:\/\/www.netrunnerdb.com\/en\/card\/03046\">SMCs<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.netrunnerdb.com\/en\/card\/02047\">Test Runs<\/a> for breakers more than Parasites, though I wouldn't fault anyone for running 1 Parasite just in case. The argument For Parasite is that it keeps the ICE layers lower, meaning you're less likely to get blown out by something tiny. I think that once you get Mimic and Yog.0 out, you need Parasite less.<\/p>\n\n<p>Comments are very welcome!<\/p>\n","username":"CJFM","cards":{"01007":1,"01008":3,"01011":2,"01014":1,"01019":3,"01026":1,"01035":3,"01038":3,"01041":2,"01044":3,"01053":3,"02003":1,"02009":2,"02047":2,"02049":3,"02066":1,"02087":2,"02107":2,"03038":3,"03040":1,"03046":3,"06017":1}},{"id":8357,"name":"NEH Psychobeale 2.1","creation":"2014-08-07 16:22:24","description":"\n","username":"edb","cards":{"01062":1,"01081":3,"01084":2,"01085":2,"01090":3,"01092":3,"01104":2,"01108":3,"01110":3,"02056":3,"02110":3,"02115":3,"02116":2,"02117":1,"04012":3,"04015":2,"04040":3,"04095":1,"04119":3,"05027":2,"06003":1,"06005":1}},{"id":8358,"name":"Burning Moon v1.5","creation":"2014-08-07 16:26:29","description":"\n","username":"willequalsftw","cards":{"01081":3,"01082":2,"01085":2,"01090":1,"01092":3,"01099":3,"01104":2,"01108":3,"01110":3,"02056":3,"02110":2,"02115":3,"02116":3,"04015":3,"04040":2,"04076":1,"04096":2,"04119":3,"04120":2,"05024":1,"05027":1,"06003":1,"06005":1}},{"id":8359,"name":"Sterling Connections","creation":"2014-08-07 16:40:30","description":"<p>I play this deck super slow, but I've had fun with it and it screws with people in my meta.

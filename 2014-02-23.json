It was undefeated at 4-0 for the day.  I'll be putting together a tournament report in the near future and link it in the comments.<\/p>\n\n<p>It's fairly similar to the Gabe deck I've been playing for several months now, though I swapped out 3 x Parasites and 3 x Datasuckers for 3 x Knight, 1 x Mimic, an extra Armitage Codebusting, and an extra Corroder.<\/p>\n\n<p>Power Shutdown and Wraparound are the primary reasons I made the switch.  With Power Shutdown, I lost my only Corroder in a tournament last month after the Corp played back-to-back Power Shutdowns to nuke a Faerie and Corroder.  With Wraparound, I typically run a single Corroder and Parasite low-strength ETR ice until I draw into or Special Order the Corroder; a strategy that Wraparound nicely circumvents.  So the extra copy of Corroder seemed like a nice play.  The other huge benefit of running Knights is more flexibility in the early-game.  Knight plays like an Inside Job, where you're virtually guaranteed to get into a server of your choosing (useful for HQ runs with Account Siphons or Emergency Shutdowns, or for R&amp;D runs with Indexing), inevitably followed by the Corp trashing that troublesome ice to work as a pseudo-Parasite.<\/p>\n\n<p>Honestly, I'm still not sure whether I prefer the Knight version or Parasite version of this deck... each has their own pros\/cons and they're both favorites of mine.  I've only been messing with this version for a couple of weeks, so we'll see if I tend to favor one or the other after more playtime for this deck.<\/p>\n\n<p>Here's the tournament report for this event:\nhttp:\/\/www.boardgamegeek.com\/thread\/1146823\/store-championship-the-yellow-king-1st-place-t<\/p>\n","username":"CrimsonWraith","cards":{"01007":2,"01011":1,"01014":1,"01017":1,"01018":3,"01021":3,"01022":3,"01024":3,"01026":1,"01028":3,"01050":3,"01053":3,"02009":3,"02043":3,"02104":3,"02106":1,"03052":3,"03054":3,"04043":3}},{"id":2512,"name":"Supermodernism","creation":"2014-02-23 01:23:40","description":"<p>My Corp deck that won the 14-player 2014 Store Championship at The Yellow King in Colorado Springs, CO. I went 3-1 with it on the day.  I'll be putting together a tournament report in the near future and link it in the comments.<\/p>\n\n<p>This is my GRNDL variant of Martin Presley's Weyland Building a Better World Supermodernism deck.  I'd been running Supermodernism in Building a Better World with 3 x Anonymous Tip, 3 x Snare!, 2 x SEA Source, and 1 x Aggressive Secretary for quite a while now.  In switching over to GRNDL and cutting five influence, I cut 1 x Tip, 1 x SEA Source, and 1 x Aggressive Secretary, and added 3 x Subliminal Messaging, a third copy of Restructure, and a single Power Grid Overload in their place.<\/p>\n\n<p>Subliminal Messaging is incredible, definitely a 2x-of in the deck.  Three copies seems a bit redundant... but then, I went a whole round without seeing a single one, so who knows.  Power Grid Overload is a bit too niche, I'll probably be swapping that out for more ice.  I went back and forth on 3x Snare and 1x SEA Source vs. 2x Snare and 2x SEA Source all week long.  I went with 2 and 2 in playtesting for the past week (I've been practicing w\/proxied GRNDL decks since last weekend), and made a last-second decision last night to switch to 3 and 1.  I've won games with both cards, using SEA Source even when I couldn't flatline the Runner to blow-up a Crash Space or Professional Contacts or loaded Kati Jones on multiple occasions, while Snare combos perfectly with scored False Leads to stick folks with unexpected tags.  In the end, I felt like Snare had the bigger impact on my practice games, so I dropped a SEA Source and added the third Snare.  I believe I made the right decision...  Snare single-handedly won my game in the final round and nearly salvaged my only loss of the whole tournament (Runner ran Maker's Eye on second click with an R&amp;D Interface out while I had a scored False Lead, hit Snare but snagged the winning agenda on the fourth card.)<\/p>\n\n<p>Now you're asking why not stick with Building a Better World so I can run 3 x Snare and 2 x SEA Source, right?  GRNDL's early game is absolutely terrifying for Runners, and the fast start is absolutely worth the starting bad publicity and loss of 5 influence.  This deck's kryptonite at the moment is Blackmail...  I believe I only played one Runner who had it in their deck, but it cost me 5 agenda points (of course, I also baited him into using Blackmail a third time on a Snare) in that one game.  If Blackmail becomes a prominent inclusion in Runner decks, I think I'll have to go back to Building a Better World.  In the meantime, I prefer GRNDL's opening bombardment.<\/p>\n\n<p>Here's the full tournament report for this Store Championship:\nhttp:\/\/www.boardgamegeek.com\/thread\/1146823\/store-championship-the-yellow-king-1st-place-t<\/p>\n","username":"CrimsonWraith","cards":{"01070":3,"01083":2,"01086":1,"01094":3,"01099":3,"01101":3,"01103":3,"01110":3,"01111":3,"01113":2,"02018":3,"02037":1,"02060":2,"02080":2,"03026":1,"04017":3,"04020":2,"04036":1,"04040":3,"04058":2,"04097":1,"04100":3}},{"id":2513,"name":"2014 The Yellow King Store Championship - 2nd Place Corp","creation":"2014-02-23 01:36:55","description":"<p>February 22nd, 2014 - Tobin L's corp deck from The Yellow King Store Championship<\/p>\n\n<p>After four rounds of Swiss, Tobin went 2-2 with this deck and finished second place overall.<\/p>\n","username":"ColoradoNetrunner","cards":{"01062":1,"01068":2,"01070":2,"01073":1,"01075":2,"01077":1,"01078":1,"01090":2,"01101":1,"01110":2,"01111":1,"01113":1,"02013":1,"02014":3,"02029":2,"02031":1,"02032":2,"02039":1,"02059":2,"02095":2,"03026":1,"03027":1,"04013":2,"04015":3,"04032":2,"04033":2,"04039":1,"04054":3,"04059":1,"04073":1,"04074":2}},{"id":2514,"name":"2014 The Yellow King Store Championship - 2nd Place Runner","creation":"2014-02-23 01:38:00","description":"<p>February 22nd, 2014 - Tobin L's Runner deck from The Yellow King Store Championship<\/p>\n\n<p>After four rounds of Swiss, Tobin went 3-1 with this deck and finished second place overall.<\/p>\n","username":"ColoradoNetrunner","cards":{"01007":2,"01014":1,"01018":3,"01021":3,"01022":2,"01024":2,"01026":1,"01028":1,"01049":2,"01050":3,"02007":1,"02009":2,"02024":1,"02025":1,"02043":2,"02083":1,"02085":1,"02087":1,"02091":1,"02104":1,"02105":1,"02107":1,"03035":1,"03038":1,"03052":2,"03054":2,"04004":1,"04049":1,"04063":2,"04065":1,"04089":2}},{"id":2515,"name":"Shock and Awe v.2","creation":"2014-02-23 02:03:07","description":"<p>If you try and steal from me, I will KILL you!<\/p>\n","username":"Kcvocals","cards":{"01068":3,"01069":2,"01070":3,"01072":2,"01075":2,"01077":2,"01078":2,"01090":1,"01110":3,"01111":1,"02014":3,"02031":1,"02032":3,"02052":2,"02095":3,"04012":2,"04013":2,"04015":1,"04032":2,"04033":1,"04040":3,"04054":3,"04073":3}},{"id":2516,"name":"HB - Damage 2.0","creation":"2014-02-23 02:21:01","description":"\n","username":"Truthius","cards":{"00004":1,"01063":3,"01070":3,"01084":2,"01099":1,"01107":2,"01108":3,"01110":3,"02011":3,"02012":3,"02051":2,"03007":2,"03009":3,"03013":3,"03015":3,"03017":2,"04010":1,"04015":3,"04030":1,"04040":3,"04071":3}},{"id":2517,"name":"AtMac store championship Grenoble winner","creation":"2014-02-23 05:35:36","description":"<p>Since I hadn't try atmen yet, this is my take at katman.

I'll likely make a couple of tweaks, though. Masanori was dead weight; I never wanted to fetch him with Hostage. Mr. Li, on the other hand, was excellent. Simply cutting Masanori and going to 2x Kati, 2x Li saves a card slot that can become another Emergency Shutdown. <\/p>\n\n<p>Another option is -2 Hostage, -1 Masanori, -1 Same Old Thing, +1 Kati, +1 Li +2 Daily Casts. I often found that I just needed an extra credit or two to start running on a given turn, so Daily Casts (which I've run in Andy before and loved) is a great option. <\/p>\n","username":"Ajar","cards":{"01007":1,"01008":3,"01011":1,"01014":1,"01018":3,"01020":1,"01021":3,"01022":3,"01024":3,"01026":1,"01038":2,"01050":3,"02009":2,"02043":1,"02083":1,"02091":1,"02104":3,"02105":1,"03052":3,"03054":1,"04004":2,"04009":1,"04061":2,"04063":3}},{"id":2530,"name":"Gabriel Santiago - 2014 Season One Build","creation":"2014-02-23 14:05:01","description":"<p>This is the Runner build I brought to a 2014 Season One tournament in Barrie (22\/02\/14).

I even made a couple of changes the day of the tournament once I picked up Fear and Loathing. Those included swapping Closed Accounts out for Interns, dropping an Ice Wall and 2x Paper Wall for 3x Wraparound, and using the free influence to swap an Enigma for a Viper. I also dropped Character Assassination in favor of Market Research.<\/p>\n\n<p>In hindsight Market Research wasn't a good idea. It seems like almost no one is floating tags these days, so without Psychographics it's essentially blank. I'll put Character Assassination back in, or potentially drop one of the 4\/2s and add 2x TGTBT. Once NAPD contract is released it'll be an instant swap.<\/p>\n\n<p>I'm not really sure what I think about Interns, mainly because I didn't play it all day. I had it in my hand a couple of times, but in every single case I either already had another SanSan in hand, never drew one, or they never trashed the one I installed. I'll keep it in for now since I think it's probably still worth the slot. I'm super happy with Viper. People are so tempted by traces; they spend an inordinate number of credits to beat the ETR trace sometimes, which I love.<\/p>\n\n<p>Overall the deck went (I think) 5-2 on the day, including the two rounds of elimination (both losses in swiss). I think with the agenda swaps I mentioned earlier it'd be considerably better.<\/p>\n","username":"weezeface","cards":{"01080":1,"01081":3,"01082":3,"01086":2,"01092":3,"01099":3,"01104":2,"01110":3,"01111":2,"01113":2,"02020":2,"02052":1,"02055":3,"02056":3,"02115":3,"03023":1,"04015":3,"04060":2,"04076":3,"04095":2,"04096":3}},{"id":2534,"name":"1st Place - 2014 Marietta, GA Store Championship (runner)","creation":"2014-02-23 17:23:15","description":"<p>I came up with this deck at 1:30 AM while driving home from trip to play in a local tournament with some friends in my hometown.

I had it in just about every game but never actually wanted to play it.<\/p>\n\n<p>dropped 3x Modded for 3x Sure Gamble - Modded was great turn 1 when I could drop Magnum Opus for 2 credits, but late-game it was basically a dead draw.<\/p>\n\n<p>dropped 1x Plascrete Carapace for 1x Levy AR Lab Access - I realized that either I could count influence and know whether or not I could float tags, I'd remove them, or I'd go for broke and race them to the finish while I chained Siphons.<\/p>\n\n<p>I'm incredibly happy with this deck.

[{"id":1298,"name":"Crim-Andromeda-Early Game Crush","creation":"2014-01-07 05:17:24","description":"<p>This deck is my take on the currently-popular Andromeda deck.  It has classic elements, i.e. sporting the Anarch breaker sweet, 3x Account Siphon, among many other staples. I do the 2x Quality time and 1x Corroder, instead of the 2x corroder 3x special order as I find this to be most effective.<\/p>\n\n<p>Where this differs is that I only sport 2 Desperado as a matter of lining up to the number I have in real life sets (1 e3 feedback implants are there instead of the third to splash against HB)<\/p>\n\n<p>The most important change I have is the addition of 2 bankjobs to beat Marked Accounts\/San San spamming\/ Asset spamming economy decks that this Andy archetype seems to have trouble with otherwise. Also, the classic 2x Hostages are to tutor your Professional Contacts (always awesome), John Masanori (against Jinteki it's amazing), and Kati Jones. I include 2x Kati Jones because a fast advanced breaking news on a San San into trashing your Kati has ruined one too many games for me (bye bye economy engine), so I throw in a backup.<\/p>\n","username":"yielderLNX","cards":{"01007":1,"01008":3,"01011":1,"01014":1,"01018":3,"01021":3,"01022":2,"01024":2,"01026":1,"01029":2,"01049":1,"01050":3,"01051":1,"02009":2,"02024":1,"02043":3,"02083":1,"02087":2,"02091":2,"02104":2,"02107":2,"03049":1,"03052":3,"04004":2,"04009":1}},{"id":1299,"name":"Bushido","creation":"2014-01-07 05:53:48","description":"<p>Katsumoto: You have seen many things.\nNathan Algren: I have.\nKatsumoto: And you do not fear death, but sometimes you wish for it.

Either will do, since PrioReq, will rez you an Hadrian's Wall on HQ for free, while The Cleaners will boost your Dedicated Response Team to 3, making any server in which the Team is installed a priority target. That's good: it keeps your remotes kinda \"off the grid\", since you'll have put some serious bling on HQ, and that's the server of choice for the Team. \nSnare! is my only doubt: it takes 4 influence that I could use in a more coherent way, splashing a Tollbooth or some other heavy guy, or adding Vipers due to their time-sucking function.\nI tried to balance ICE as much as possible, and am considering switching gates  to 3 enigmas: even though they are weak, with Troubleshooter they are a potential agenda score on my off server.\nSumming up my doubts, I might go -2 Snare +2 Viper -2 Datapike +1 Enigma (And I'll make room to use the 2 influences).\nComments welcome!<\/p>\n","username":"Kable","cards":{"01065":2,"01069":1,"01070":2,"01091":1,"01102":3,"01103":3,"01106":2,"01108":2,"01111":2,"01112":2,"02018":2,"02019":2,"02057":2,"02059":3,"02076":1,"02098":2,"02111":2,"02118":3,"03024":1,"03025":2,"03027":2,"04017":2,"04020":1,"04036":2,"04038":3}},{"id":1301,"name":"Spanish Inquisition v4","creation":"2014-01-07 10:31:41","description":"<p>Fourth revision of <a href=\"http:\/\/netrunnerdb.com\/en\/decklist\/1254\/spanish-inquisition-v3\">this deck<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>Basically just a small update, everything about the <a href=\"http:\/\/netrunnerdb.com\/en\/decklist\/1254\/spanish-inquisition-v3\">previous revision<\/a> still applies.

Exile seems like the choice, because of the free card draw, kate would possibly be equally beneficial, but the idea is that money isn't the issue.<\/p>\n\n<p>The economy:\nSince we're not breaking subroutines for dollars most of the time (bypassing still counts with femme :\/), money can run in the 'build a rig' range of cash.  So, aesops based econ with Daily casts and armitage, bolstered by lucky find and SG should be perfectly fine.  Supplement draw with money with Pro Con and we should be good.<\/p>\n\n<p>The breaker package\nOvermind breaks everything, and saves counters with GHook and D4v1d.  D4v1d takes care of wraparound (worst use), and the big boys.  Both D4v1d and OM like ghook to make them more better.  LLDS reduces breaking costs further by taking care of \"one to pump\" and adds a fallback aesops target if cash just isn't showing up.  Same old thing is in the deck to trigger levy in bad situations, and scavenge femme around in good situations.  Test run femme + scavenge is always a great play in shaper, you can't have enough copies with Exile in the mix (gets you a card every time!).  <\/p>\n\n<p>Extras\nAs the game goes on and the ice layers, the toolbox helps do some heavy lifting giving you more counters on our guy OM, and 2 credits to go along with the LLDS money savings.  SMC and clonechip help find the one-shots (Deus and SharpShooter, as well as D4v1d and Ghook when you can't draw them).  D4v1d might be better as faerie, and just run tinkering, but I'm not sold on that yet.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Are the cost savings of spending tokens to break subroutines enough to merit consideration?  Is Slysquid right that Aesop's is an awesome econ card?   I think the answer to these, and many more questions, is an emphatic, YES!<\/p>\n\n<p>Changes?\nIf money is more rampant than I expect, I might consider putting in some cybersolutions memchips, maybe even in place of the akamatsus!  <\/p>\n\n<p>Prepaid voicepad?  Probably not unless it goes the Kate route. <\/p>\n\n<p>Multiaccess?  Definitely a needed component, if the base package works, then we can work on multi access facets.

First stage is to tax the runner, get assets down, use Jacksons to dump all agendas into archives to shuffle back in. Second stage is setting up the first scoring out of hand, which is amassing credits, amassing four advancement counters on Ice Wall for Trick of Light. If the runner hasn't scored a Medical, then Trick of Light + Sansan is needed. As soon as the Sansan is rezzed, it needs the Wall of Thorns of Susanoo above it, along with a Caprice, all to protect it, with the credits to back it up. <\/p>\n\n<p>This deck failed too readily to Whizzard decks, as he ignores the asset trash tax, and is able to apply pressure early enough that the second stage never really happens, which means the critical mass of credits needed to pump out agendas doesn't occur either.

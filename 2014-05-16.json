The idea is that once you install the agenda (might be 0 advance) in your remote, u can swap-around the ICE to make it the most taxing for the runner to get there and imagine if they don't get the bid on Caprice+ Ruhr after that lol.

You start laying out Sundews and Pad Campaigns, and it looks like a very traditional RP vertical set-up. The ice is not too expensive, and will just go in front of HQ, R&amp;D, and Archives to keep the runner taxed as they try to keep your remotes economy from getting too crazy. Heck, if they do not seem to be running your remotes, you can even start scoring unprotected agendas until they realize what you are doing.<\/p>\n\n<p>But then you draw your Scorched Earth. Excellent. Eventually, they will get down to three or fewer cards in hand. Maybe they will hit Komainu or Tsurugi (or an Inazuma!) too close to the end of their turn. Maybe they will pull a Snare! from R&amp;D. Maybe they will hit your Psychic Field you put in an unprotected remote (or they exposed it). Or maybe they just won't be thinking this deck is trying to kill them (this happens a lot) and just not draw up at the end of a turn. But whatever the reason, it will eventually happen. Then you drop the Cerebral Cast and they look at you funny. And they now get to choose: brain damage or tag. Either way, you win. If they take the tag, they die as you happily show them the Scorched Earth in your hand, the one they just moments ago foolishly assumed you were not packing. If they take the brain damage (this has never actually happened to me when I was playing someone who is playing this deck for the first time), then the chances of them getting down to three cards at the end of your turn increases, and when it happens, you pull this same move again.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now, the deck is slightly more complicated than that, but that is generally how it works. Let\u2019s look at a few aspects of the deck to better understand some of the finer points.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Agendas<\/h2>\n\n<p>All of the Agenda\u2019s in the deck are selected to be able to be put in a remote one turn, looking like a Sundew or Pad Campaign or whatever else, and the next turn advanced and scored (or just scored out of hand in the case of Clone Retirement). If they do not appear to be running your Remote Servers, start playing Agendas in unprotected remote servers as described above. This gives you an advantage in points and forces the runner to speed up their game as they get worried, and it forces them to run more and set-up less, so they will have less creds and be less prepared.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Economy<\/h2>\n\n<p>Pad Campaign, Sundew, and Hedge Fund do a pretty good job of taking care of your economic needs, especially if you can get them out early game. And as discussed above, this helps keep your cover as a \u201cpeaceful\u201d Jinteki deck (ha!).<\/p>\n\n<h2>Ice<\/h2>\n\n<p>The ice is designed to just protect your Central Servers a bit, but more to tax your opponent if they want to get to your remote servers. None of this Ice can just be encountered and allowed to fire off, without forcing some damage on the runner (which we don\u2019t mind at all). The one exception to this is the single Himitsu-Bako. What is he doing there? Well, keep him in hand. He is your little secret. Later in the game when every credit matters, it is amazing how useful it is to lay him down in a new remote, put an agenda behind it, and let the runner realize too late that they need a barrier breaker out. It requires some timing, but it is amazing how well it works.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Cerebral and Scorch<\/h2>\n\n<p>As explained in the summary above, you use this to tag and bag. If needed, you should use Jackson to recover used Cerebral Casts, but this is actually rarely ever needed. It is also good to remember that Neural EMPs can be used to increase your kill range by one point. And also, in the unlikely event that they do decide to take the Brain Damage, DO NOT GIVE AWAY THAT YOU WERE HOPING THEY WOULD TAKE THE TAG! This requires some bluffing\/acting. It is hard to keep cool, but if you can\u2019t then this deck is probably not for you.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Neural EMP<\/h2>\n\n<p>A classic. And better when no one thinks it is in your deck. When someone hits the Psychic Field or a Komainu, you can effectively use these to finish them off before anything even gets going. In all of the competitive play I have done with this deck, no one is ever worried about a kill from RP (a.k.a. White Tree). Use this to your advantage.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Snare!<\/h2>\n\n<p>Snare is always good. But as Weyland players know all too well, the tag is just as dangerous as the damage. Once you start laying down remotes and they are not running them right away (usually waiting for you to Rez them first), then you start playing Agendas. Well, once they see this, they simply can\u2019t keep allowing you to score Agendas. That is when you lay down the Snare!, and chances are, they will run it and take that tag. And with low cards, they may choose to draw cards rather than remover the tag. Or if they remove the tag but don\u2019t draw back up to a full hand, it allows you to Cerebral and Scorch. It\u2019s great!<\/p>\n\n<h2>False Leads<\/h2>\n\n<p>This is one of the few things that may tip off an opponent, but I think it is worth it. They may assume you have it in the deck to allow you to score an agenda, not for a kill. But if they take a tag from a Snare! (or give themselves a tag from an Account Syphon) or let their hand size drop to 1 or 0, use it and finish them off with the Scorch or Neural EMP. This is a powerful card in the right build, and this is that build. That one extra click they have to make before running remotes is PERFECT for this card.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Psychic Field<\/h2>\n\n<p>Well, there are a few reason for this seemingly out-of-place card. First, it can get your opponent down to 0 cards in hand, ripe for a Neural EMP. That is obvious. But also, Expose abilities are more and more common in runner decks, and this hits them right when they thought they were being careful, trigger off of an expose as well as an access. And it adds some variety and a bit of uncertainty in the runner\u2019s mind. It might not be for everyone, but I have had great success with it in this deck.<\/p>\n","username":"thewestwinds","cards":{"01070":3,"01072":2,"01099":3,"01109":3,"01110":3,"02014":3,"02031":1,"02080":3,"04013":1,"04015":3,"04032":3,"04054":3,"04074":3,"05005":3,"05006":1,"05010":1,"05013":3,"05016":2,"05017":3,"05018":3}},{"id":5664,"name":"Event Kate 1.1","creation":"2014-05-16 17:44:32","description":"<p>This is my take on an event driver Kate deck.

The key card for setting up those ambushes and Trick of Light-batteries is Mushin no Shin.<\/p>\n\n<p>Agendas<\/p>\n\n<p>This is a standard Jinteki-Fast Advance assortment of agendas. All agendas are worth 2 points, so it always takes 3 agendas to win. 6 out of 9 agendas cost 3 or less (Braintrusts, 2nd and 3rd Medical Breakthroughs, and Philotic Entanglement). These can all be scored off of 1) a Mushin no Shin, 2) a Mushin'ed Plan B, or 3) a Trick of Light, making use of a failed ambush. Meanwhile, the 4-difficulty agendas are not meant for scoring, except in need. The NAPD contracts are taxing to steal, and the 1st Medical Breakthrough is useful regardless of whether it is scored or stolen.<\/p>\n\n<p>Assets<\/p>\n\n<p>There are five ambushes that are meant for Mushin no Shin. 3-advanced Junebugs are great for a flatline. A 3-advanced AggSecretary will curb-stomp a rig, and it is also useful at 1- or 2-advancements, if Mushin is not available. 3-advanced Plan Bs will score 6 out of 9 agendas. If the runner does not go for these traps, they become Trick of Light batteries. Meanwhile, Jackson Howard smooths out the flow of agendas. Shi.Kyu defends Archives, and potentially forces the runner to need 4 agendas to win.<\/p>\n\n<p>Operations<\/p>\n\n<p>Mushin no Shin and Trick of Light are the all-stars in this deck. The rest of the operations are a variety of economy cards. Green Level Clearance speeds up the deck while giving cash, and Hedge Fund is Hedge Fund. This deck does not need a ton of economy, since Mushin and Trick are cheap, and the ICE is pretty affordable. Also, Mushin no Shin is a sort of economy and a very effective one at that.<\/p>\n\n<p>ICE<\/p>\n\n<p>This is a rush deck, so the ICE layout includes lots of cheap End the Run (Himitsu-Bako, Quandary, Guard, Chimera). Guard is especially useful for single-handedly protecting a Mushin'ed agenda in an early-game rush. The rest of the ICE is more taxing and meant for protecting the centrals (Eli 1.0, Komainu, Tsurugi, Ichi 1.0, Grim). Inazuma is the one piece of positional ICE, but it is awesome in front of an Ichi 1.0, Komainu, or Tsurugi.<\/p>\n\n<p>Other Notes<\/p>\n\n<p>I had Hives in here, but they would crap out on me right when I need them the most, i.e. right when the runner was starting to really pound the centrals. I also tried out a GRNDL Refinery--it might be good, but I had to cut something in order to upgrade elsewhere. I'm not sure if Green Level Clearance is the ideal economy choice, but I think that it works better in this deck than Celebrity Gift did. Information is too precious. There are plenty of things that I wish that I could add--a second Shi.Kyu to ensure that the runner needs four agendas, another Aggressive Secretary, some sort of recursion (I briefly tried out a 1x Reclamation Order, but it was unlikely to show up when it was useful), or Fast Track for grabbing the third Medical Breakthrough.<\/p>\n","username":"chemnitz","cards":{"01057":1,"01062":1,"01069":2,"01110":3,"02014":3,"02033":3,"02060":1,"02070":3,"02110":3,"04013":2,"04015":2,"04020":1,"04074":1,"04119":2,"04120":2,"05001":1,"05005":3,"05006":1,"05011":1,"05015":3,"05016":1,"05017":1,"05023":2,"05024":2}},{"id":5674,"name":"Misdirection in Medtech","creation":"2014-05-16 22:14:36","description":"<p>It's simply just a 50-50 chance of getting an Agenda or a trap especially when one of them is installed via Mushin no Shin (a Junebug can mean instant kill).

So if I didn't draw a fast econ in my mandatory draw and I got nothing to do, I'll just spend my turn gaining 3-creds.<\/p>\n\n<p>HQ and Archive traps include Shock!, Snare!, and Shi.Kyu, while remote traps include Cerebral Overwriter, and Project Junebug;\nSusanoo-no-Mikoto and Inazuma are a very good duo since it can also tax aside from flushing Runners to archives that's of course full of Shocks and Shi.Kyus; Shiro is also a good top deck filterer, and a bit of taxing; Komainu, Tsurugi, and Wall of Thorns are a bit expensive (that is why I put Priority Requisition), but also efficient in buying time to set up (since they tax-up the Runners), and also can be aggressive in net damage; Celebrity Gift, Medical Research Fundraiser, and Hedge Fund for fast econs.<\/p>\n\n<p>Any thoughts? Thanks for reading!<\/p>\n","username":"Saintry","cards":{"01069":3,"01070":3,"01078":2,"01106":3,"01110":3,"03009":2,"04012":3,"04073":2,"04074":2,"05001":1,"05007":3,"05011":2,"05014":3,"05015":3,"05016":3,"05017":2,"05019":2,"05020":3}}]

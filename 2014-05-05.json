By that time there is a good chance that you have already scored a Hostile Takeover and have a remote server with strong ICE (Hadrian's Wall, Archer, Swarm) and ready to settle the game.<\/p>\n\n<p>Cards:<\/p>\n\n<p>Corporate Troubleshooter(CT): It can hold a server for a turn when you want to score or when you are want to hurt the runner. Exemple:\n- Woodcutter + CT: Game ender. There is only one copy as the deck don't   focus on flatlining the runner.<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Archer + CT: Trash 2 of his nastiest programs + ETR.<\/li>\n<li>Swarm + CT: Trash EVERYTHING, it's pretty much a reset bottom for the runner.<\/li>\n<li>Hadrian's Wall + CT: I don't think you'll need it for this one...<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Reclamation Order(RO): You dropped 2-3 BeanStalk or Hedge Fund and need money to rez a Hadrian's Wall next turn? Even better, you played 2-3 Commercialization a few turn before. Hit a RO and laugh with the runner about how ridiculous your credit pool just popped up.<\/p>\n\n<p>Ice Wall: This is your favorite one early one. You want it on your R&amp;D and keep advancing it up to around 10 if possible. If it gets there then...$$ (chiching). + Ice Wall is better than a Hadrian's Wall at this point simply because a Emergency Shutdown or something similar can't hurt your economy with this one.<\/p>\n","username":"Exo","cards":{"01065":2,"01089":3,"01090":1,"01094":3,"01098":3,"01100":3,"01101":2,"01102":2,"01103":3,"01104":2,"01106":2,"01110":3,"01111":3,"02018":1,"02039":3,"02057":1,"02058":3,"02076":1,"02099":2,"04015":1,"04018":2,"04060":1,"04111":2,"04118":1}},{"id":5080,"name":"Jingerly v2","creation":"2014-05-05 20:16:16","description":"<p>Jingeryly is playing to the theme that the Runner must step lightly, while at the same time, puts the pressure on though the threat of Mushi and Agenda scoring.

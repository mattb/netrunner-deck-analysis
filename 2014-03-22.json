This allows me to mess with their grip, their stack and gives me more control over the game. I can win either by scorching (after invading his privacy) or scoring agendas out of hand via psychographics. I don't even need to set up a remote which I think is kinda nice too.<\/p>\n\n<p>The only card I am not sure about at the moment is midseason, since it feels kinda unneeded at the moment. The runner will float a lot of tags at some point thanks to Bernice May and ChiLo. Maybe I'll have to try it out vs don't-tag-me runners first before I come to a conclusion whether to keep midseason or not.<\/p>\n","username":"Maximus","cards":{"01080":1,"01081":3,"01082":2,"01084":2,"01085":2,"01090":1,"01099":2,"01110":2,"02017":1,"02019":2,"02036":2,"02052":3,"02056":3,"02096":2,"02097":2,"02115":3,"02116":2,"02117":1,"04016":2,"04056":2,"04076":3,"04095":3,"04096":2,"04100":2}},{"id":3359,"name":"Knight Gabe (Helsinki Fantsu 22.3.2014)","creation":"2014-03-22 12:03:46","description":"<p>Fantasiapelit Helsinki store championship, 4 win 0 loss<\/p>\n","username":"Roppa","cards":{"01007":2,"01011":1,"01014":1,"01017":1,"01018":3,"01021":3,"01022":3,"01024":3,"01026":1,"01028":2,"01029":2,"01049":1,"01050":3,"02009":3,"02043":3,"02085":2,"02104":3,"02106":1,"03052":2,"03054":3,"04043":3}},{"id":3360,"name":"HB Fast Advance (Helsinki Fantsu 22.3.2014)","creation":"2014-03-22 12:14:18","description":"<p>Helsinki Fantasiapelit store championship, 3 win 1 loss<\/p>\n","username":"Mixmasteri","cards":{"01054":1,"01055":3,"01056":3,"01059":3,"01064":3,"01090":2,"01092":2,"01101":1,"01110":3,"01113":2,"02051":3,"02052":2,"02092":3,"02110":3,"03005":3,"03011":1,"03015":1,"03017":1,"03019":2,"03023":2,"04015":3,"04100":3}},{"id":3361,"name":"Ice Eater","creation":"2014-03-22 14:09:08","description":"<p>The main purpose is to decrese the strength of the ices with datasucker, bishop and parasite and then get over them with the breakers.

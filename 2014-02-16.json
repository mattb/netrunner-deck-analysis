I've moved from FA decks that use any 4\/2 to no (in  case, still one) 4\/2. I prefer the 3\/2 or 3\/1 so I'm never stuck holding a character assassination (or efficiency committee) instead of scoring. The increased agenda density doesn't mean much, it still takes 4 agenda minimum and it may take more depending on what the runner pulls. Focus on scoring any 3\/2 you draw and let the runner spend creds going for (hopefully) a 3\/1. There will be games you will lose because the runner lucked into the 3\/2s while you were stuck with the 3\/1s. It hasn't been common though. Many games seem to go to 5 agendas scored to win and the economic drain of having to score the 5th agenda, as well as the taxing ICE, tilts the balance a little in your favor since your ability to score isn't made any more difficult. I would like to get two more 3\/1 agendas over the character assassination, as well as 1-2 more interns to return Sansan, ASH, or Red herrings, but I don't want to drop any more ICE or economy. <\/p>\n","username":"HepatitvsJ","cards":{"01064":3,"01080":1,"01081":3,"01091":2,"01092":3,"01110":3,"01113":2,"02013":2,"02017":3,"02019":3,"02052":2,"02056":3,"02115":3,"03023":3,"04014":1,"04015":3,"04060":1,"04075":3,"04076":3,"04077":3}},{"id":2280,"name":"Noise: Mill 'em ad nauseum v2","creation":"2014-02-16 10:42:04","description":"<p>This is an updated version of a deck I posted a while ago: http:\/\/netrunnerdb.com\/en\/decklist\/1582\/mill--em-ad-nauseum---a-nearly-naked-runner<\/p>\n\n<p>The object of the deck is to always have options, and always be milling.

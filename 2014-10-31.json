And with all the money you leverage the Midseason. Information Overload on RnD and HQ after the Midseason lock the runner out while you wait to draw scorches or Psychographics. Once the runners board is wiped you can play a Wraparound or Quandary and watch the hopelessly bounce off your cheap binary ice. Data hound and Invasion of Privacy are interesting. If a runner isn't careful and dips to low on credits you can snipe important cards from their grip or stack. They must get a sentry breaker or pay the trace. The one of net police can be a dead draw against some runners but at least you draw off installing it. Against runners with link it can prove invaluable as it makes landing the midseasons or Invasion traces easier. I present to you a different and more interesting way to play NBN. Get a ton of credits then install advance advance. Is that a 3 pointer? Or maybe a Shattered Remains?

Move faster.<\/p>\n\n<p>This hardware-centric Kit build gets set up fast with Replicator, Inside Man, and Astrolabe. The newest Shaper console works wonders here. The more the corp tries to expand their server portfolio, the quicker you can get yourself set up, and that additional 1 MU will make a world of difference in the amount of pressure you can put on. Now you can have your Magnum Opus, a breaker, and an SMC in play without having to have dropped up to 4 credits on your CyberSolutions.<\/p>\n\n<p>The biggest change here is the freed up influence for a one-off Imp. To make room, I dropped the Datasucker\/Parasite combo. I originally ran them both for a number of reasons (Datasucker to carry some of the load against the heaviest of glaciers, and Parasite to nuke iced up centrals in RP that would essentially negate Kit's ability), but in nearly 50 plays with this deck, I can't say I've consistently been happy to draw into either card. Using the cards, when they do pop up, is almost never the best option as I've found that the problems they solve can be worked around with the number of stealth options the deck packs. Taking a closer look then, Imp makes much more sense. You will almost always end up with early multi-access pressure, and that means you can start digging to kill off combo pieces. It can very often be worth it to install an HQI or two, and do a scouting run before installing Imp. If you see things you like on the first run, find a way to get the Imp into play (install, SMC, clone chip), and head back in. Use it to control the corp's game plan, but make sure you don't tip your hand and reveal Imp before it's time to start wreaking havoc. You want to ensure you get to use it a little more efficiently than just sniping a Hedge Fund when they could eventually be holding a Biotic or a SanSan, or any other nastiness you can't pay to throw in archives.<\/p>\n\n<p>This build isn't wildly different from the first version that inspired it. The second copy of Magnum Opus is out, which can put a little more weight on your Clone Chips' shoulders should it get trashed, but since I almost always SMC out the Mopus, drawing into the second was always a disappointment. Drawing into Magnum Opus, is of course, perfection, but don't expect that to happen often, and definitely don't wait for it to happen. Instead, tutor for it with an early SMC; getting your econ online should be your number one priority, sometimes even before getting that Cloak\/Refractor up depending on the match-up. Otherwise, if you wait too you're going to bleed yourself dry making runs without the monetary backup to carry you farther into the game. Mopus is also key because it's your Scorch\/Midseasons protection in a deck that just doesn't have time for Plascrete. Don't be afraid to click for 8 whenever you feel comfortable: your win rate with this deck will skyrocket when you can start to identify economy windows. Give it a try and let me know how it works for you!<\/p>\n","username":"BTrain","cards":{"01044":1,"01050":3,"02003":1,"02068":2,"02085":2,"02087":3,"02088":3,"02107":3,"03028":1,"03038":3,"03041":3,"03042":1,"03046":3,"04006":3,"04086":3,"06038":2,"06040":3,"06053":1,"06057":3,"06079":2}},{"id":10371,"name":"Event Overload V35.3","creation":"2014-10-31 11:40:43","description":"\n","username":"ThisIsAzrael","cards":{"01026":1,"01034":3,"01036":2,"01037":2,"01042":1,"01049":1,"01050":3,"02046":1,"02047":3,"02087":2,"02106":2,"03035":2,"03052":2,"04004":1,"04027":3,"04047":1,"04107":3,"04109":3,"05035":2,"05054":2,"06038":1}},{"id":10372,"name":"Quetzal the Infiltrator v0.0","creation":"2014-10-31 15:09:30","description":"<p>My first attempt at Quetzal.

Ps Swap the 2 diversified portfolio with two data mine<\/p>\n","username":"gabsnow18","cards":{"01060":2,"01063":3,"01064":1,"01070":3,"01072":2,"01106":3,"01110":3,"02053":2,"05001":1,"05007":3,"05008":2,"05010":3,"05011":3,"05016":3,"05017":2,"05019":1,"05022":3,"05026":2}}]

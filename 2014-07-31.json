So I've built this deck around the old big-rig adage: \"Efficient breakers, and the rest of your deck for money.\" Corps dread that beefy Shaper econ, and have to build up to make sure they can deal with it by the mid-game, by the time it's usually kicking in. But Nasir's ability, when played with proper Workshop or SMC use, turns economy, rig-building, and runs into the same thing - the main thing the corp usually does to slow you down (rezzing ice) is now the one thing that makes your early game so strong.<\/p>\n\n<p>That need to make sure your econ is online ASAP is why this deck runs 3x <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01044\">Magnum Opus<\/a>, and 3x <a href=\"\/en\/card\/03053\">Daily Casts<\/a>. These will get you flush with cash to dump into a <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02049\">Personal Workshop<\/a> during your runs, or to pop an SMC and get your big breakers out before your credit pool resets - and that's if the corp chooses to rez in the first place. If you have either your Workshop or an SMC on the table, and start a run with a lot of money, the corp player is forced into a position where they know you can deal with whatever ice they rez, and then have to decide whether it's even worth it to give you the money.<\/p>\n\n<p>I'm running a <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04047\">Torch<\/a> instead of a <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01043\">Gordian Blade<\/a>, because I'm looking to make this deck hit as hard as it possibly can, and you should hardly be strapped for cash with this load-out. <a href=\"\/en\/card\/03048\">Inti<\/a> is in as a safeguard to deal with the low-strength barriers in a pinch, and I almost always like to drop it before my <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02004\">Morning Star<\/a> to get the corp comfortable with plopping down low-to mid strength barriers. I can also the case for a <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02027\">Snowball<\/a>, or even dropping a <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01012\">Parasite<\/a> to free up the influence for a <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01007\">Corroder<\/a>, but I like it as it is now.<\/p>\n\n<p>I've freed up space in the deck for 3x <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01036\">Maker's Eyes<\/a> and 3x <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02107\">R&amp;D Interface<\/a> for deep, game-winning R&amp;D digs.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"\/en\/card\/02003\">Imp<\/a> is in as a one-off to help you get rid of any assets should hit a SanSan you can't afford to trash or an NAPD you don't have the money to score. The deck also runs 2x <a href=\"\/en\/card\/03034\">Scavenges<\/a> to give Imp extra staying power.<\/p>\n\n<p>I've also one-offed a <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02065\">Crescentus<\/a> to add another layer of pressure on the corp. It's the Nasir equivalent of <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02021\">Vamp<\/a>, and acts as a great SMC-able way to kick the corp when they're down.<\/p>\n","username":"BTrain","cards":{"01012":3,"01026":1,"01034":1,"01036":3,"01041":2,"01044":3,"02003":1,"02004":1,"02009":2,"02049":3,"02065":1,"02091":2,"02106":2,"02107":3,"03034":2,"03035":1,"03038":3,"03046":3,"03048":1,"03053":3,"04047":1,"04086":3,"06017":1}},{"id":8114,"name":"Scorching the Future","creation":"2014-07-31 02:05:37","description":"<p>Made this as a backup deck to play when I'm not playing my main Jinteki RP deck (which is where the Hedge Funds live).

So I've built this deck around the old big-rig adage: \"Efficient breakers, and the rest of your deck for money.\" Corps dread that beefy Shaper econ, and have to build up to make sure they can deal with it by the mid-game, by the time it's usually kicking in. But Nasir's ability, when played with proper Workshop or SMC use, turns economy, rig-building, and runs into the same thing - the main thing the corp usually does to slow you down (rezzing ice) is now the one thing that makes your early game so strong.<\/p>\n\n<p>This decks has econ in the form 2x <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01044\">Magnum Opus<\/a>, and econ\/draw from 3x <a href=\"\/en\/card\/03049\">Professional Contacts<\/a>. These will get you flush with cash to dump into a <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02049\">Personal Workshop<\/a> during your runs, or to pop an SMC and get your big breakers out before your credit pool resets - and that's if the corp chooses to rez in the first place. If you have either your Workshop or an SMC on the table, and start a run with a lot of money, the corp player is forced into a position where they know you can deal with whatever ice they rez, and then have to decide whether it's even worth it to give you the money.<\/p>\n\n<p>New in v2.0, I've retooled the breaker suite and have dropped <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04047\">Torch<\/a> for a <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01043\">Gordian Blade<\/a>. I've also freed up space for 3x <a href=\"\/en\/card\/03040\">Atmans<\/a> by dropping a Clone Chip, an RDI and a Test Run. I found myself overdrawing into these cards more often than not, which might not seem like a bad thing, but recurring with Clone Chip isn't as important as I thought it would be. Plus you only need two RDI's online before each run becomes a Maker's Eye. And running Atman with a rich Nasir should get you into plenty of servers. <\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"\/en\/card\/02106\">Indexing<\/a> is also down to only one copy. I find myself always wanting to hold them for the perfect situations, and those don't come up terribly often once you get out of the early game. The last thing I need is an extra card clogging up my hand, or my deck. <\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"\/en\/card\/02003\">Imp<\/a> stays in as a one-off to help you get rid of any assets should hit a SanSan you can't afford to trash or an NAPD you don't have the money to score (then money up, and snatch it from archives). The deck also runs 3x <a href=\"\/en\/card\/03034\">Scavenges<\/a> to give Imp extra staying power. You can also use it to retool strength on Atman or reposition your Femme token.<\/p>\n\n<p>I've also one-offed a <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02065\">Crescentus<\/a> to add another layer of pressure on the corp. It's the Nasir equivalent of <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02021\">Vamp<\/a>, only more powerful, and acts as a great SMC-able way to kick the corp when they're down.<\/p>\n","username":"BTrain","cards":{"01012":3,"01026":1,"01034":2,"01041":2,"01043":1,"01044":2,"02003":1,"02004":1,"02009":2,"02047":2,"02049":3,"02065":1,"02091":2,"02106":1,"02107":2,"03034":3,"03035":1,"03038":2,"03040":3,"03046":3,"03048":1,"03049":3,"04086":3,"06017":1}}]

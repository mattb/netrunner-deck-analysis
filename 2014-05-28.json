After several plays, I've tailored it to my needs. Basically, the deck is more flexible right now, and if things go bad with Scorching, you can quickly adapt and switch to scoring 3 pointers out of hand.<\/p>\n\n<p>The basic premise is - don't rez ICE early, gather substantial amount of money, so that you can safely rez and keep your cards. Try to score Efficiency Committee or just keep a combination of Biotic Labor and Archived Memories\/Reclamation Order. The whole setup is to tag runner with Sea Source (so you need more money), and to fire as many Scorched Earths in one turn you can (so you need even more money and few extra clicks). Use Archived Memories to get Scorch back into hand. It's totally possible to deal 12 or even 16 meat damage one turn - don't be disheartened by that Plascrete on the other side.<\/p>\n\n<p>Reclamation Order can be used to recycle economy, especially worth it, when 3 cards are in archives. You can use it for Scorches or Biotics too, obviously.<\/p>\n\n<p>You probably want to get more agendas on hand, where they're more safe and you have more options, but be aware of late game Siphons, that could wreck your plan. You always should have a 3-4 credits above your current hand size.<\/p>\n\n<p>Psychic Field is a star of this deck - a one time surprise, that you most often will draw into during the game. Since you don't create remotes with this deck, if you install it, it makes runner curious. Most often they take it as an agenda bait or SanSan, so they run. If you can win the bid, you can save on up to 2 Scorches in next turn.<\/p>\n\n<p>Everything else is just plain event economy and draw engine. You might want to change your ICE setup somehow, it doesn't matter that much. With strong players, you can almost certainly drop tagging ICE - it doesn't work. 1xData Raven here is just used for desperate plays (that sometimes work in late game). You don't want your ICE to be too expensive, but still taxing. Strategically placed Heimdall can shut runner down from getting into a central.<\/p>\n\n<p>It has won a fair share of games. Bad economy draw against early Siphons is the biggest problem. After you survive first 3-4 turns and you have some economy options, things generally tend to snowball towards your win.<\/p>\n","username":"rattkin","cards":{"01055":2,"01058":3,"01059":3,"01061":2,"01062":2,"01086":2,"01088":1,"01099":2,"01110":3,"01111":2,"02051":3,"02052":2,"02070":2,"02110":2,"03001":1,"03005":2,"03019":2,"04040":3,"04090":3,"04111":2,"04119":3,"05010":1,"05024":2}},{"id":6139,"name":"Proper Police Procedure","creation":"2014-05-28 07:38:12","description":"<p>The goal here is to gather your evidence and credits and then make inquiries into certain servers once you have a decent rig.<\/p>\n","username":"wdlp","cards":{"01018":2,"01019":3,"01021":3,"01028":2,"01030":2,"01049":3,"01050":3,"02105":2,"03055":1,"04089":1,"04109":3,"05028":1,"05033":3,"05037":3,"05041":2,"05042":2,"05046":2,"05048":3,"05053":3,"06060":2}},{"id":6140,"name":"The Soldiery 2014 Store Championship Winning GRNDL","creation":"2014-05-28 09:19:52","description":"\n","username":"D3liverance","cards":{"01070":3,"01086":1,"01094":3,"01099":3,"01101":3,"01103":3,"01110":3,"01111":3,"01113":2,"02018":3,"02060":2,"02080":2,"03026":1,"04015":2,"04017":3,"04020":2,"04036":1,"04040":3,"04058":2,"04097":1,"04099":2,"04100":2}},{"id":6141,"name":"Dedicated trap v1.1","creation":"2014-05-28 10:21:46","description":"<p>Tweaking the old Data Raven DRT idea. <\/p>\n","username":"vreely","cards":{"01070":3,"01072":3,"01088":3,"01110":3,"02031":1,"02039":1,"02059":3,"02118":3,"04013":3,"04054":3,"04060":3,"04074":2,"04093":3,"04114":2,"04119":3,"04120":3,"05006":1,"05007":3}},{"id":6142,"name":"If it Bleeds, it Leads","creation":"2014-05-28 10:25:18","description":"<p>And hopefully, it will bleed a lot.<\/p>\n","username":"hypomodern","cards":{"01080":1,"01081":3,"01082":2,"01084":1,"01085":3,"01090":1,"01092":2,"01099":3,"01110":3,"01111":1,"01113":2,"02020":3,"02056":2,"02110":3,"02115":3,"02116":3,"02117":1,"04015":2,"04076":3,"04096":1,"04113":1,"04119":3,"04120":1,"05027":2}},{"id":6143,"name":"A Beautiful (Damaged) Mind","creation":"2014-05-28 11:04:07","description":"<p>Here is the current version of my Kit deck as discussed on Netrunner Live: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=93AX7_2s9FA <\/p>\n\n<p>The basic idea of this deck is to use yog, overmind and stimhack to produce an immense amount of pressure early game and toolbox with torch is used for the mid-late game consistent pressure (often scavenge yog for torch mid\/late game once datasuckers get shut down).

(Having scored 2 Mandatory Upgrades is ridiculous, you can draw into Agendas for example with <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04015\">Jackson Howard<\/a> and score them out of your hand in a single turn.)<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Having an extra click every turn feels amazing!<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Now that we know, that scoring <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02011\">Mandatory Upgrades<\/a> early is great, how are we actually scoring a 6\/2 Agenda? \nFirst, we need cheap, efficient and resistant ICE to protect the Agenda after a <a href=\"\/en\/card\/05015\">Mushin No Shin<\/a>. \n<a href=\"\/en\/card\/04059\">Paper Wall<\/a> and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04120\">Quandary<\/a> are cheap, so use them if you and the runner are both low on credits. Be aware, that the runner can drain some credits by running central server. Try to always be able to score <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02011\">Mandatory Upgrades<\/a> next turn.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"\/en\/card\/05024\">Guard<\/a> can be necessary, if you feel the need to be safe against Inside Job. \n<a href=\"\/en\/card\/04117\">Hive<\/a> on the other hand is excellent, if the runner relies on expensive AI-Breakers (Knight for example needs 10 credits to break it early on, Crypsis needs a virus token and 8 credits, Overmind probably isn't even able to break it at all.).<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"\/en\/card\/01057\">Aggressive Secretary<\/a> and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/03009\">Cerebral Overwriter<\/a> can be really backbreaking if you can trick the opponent with a <a href=\"\/en\/card\/05015\">Mushin No Shin<\/a> into an somewhat expensive run on that server so that he\/she cannot steal your <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02011\">Mandatory Upgrades<\/a> out of the Remote Server that follows because he\/she needs to recover. But be aware, that <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01057\">Aggressive Secretary<\/a> does not do anything against a Runner with no programs (should be common sense though).\n<a href=\"\/en\/card\/01056\">Adonis Campaign<\/a> can be crucial to the strategy, because it can protect you from Account Siphon and then gives you the 3 credits at the start of your turn, so you can score <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02011\">Mandatory Upgrades<\/a> even if you were broke. <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04034\">Shipment from SanSan<\/a> can also help to score <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02011\">Mandatory Upgrades<\/a> while being low on credits.<\/p>\n\n<p>No <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01110\">Hedge Fund<\/a> means, that we have to rely on economy assets like <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01108\">Melange Mining Corp.<\/a> and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01056\">Adonis Campaign<\/a>. Don't be afraid to click for credits, if that is what you need, to be safe and score an <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02011\">Mandatory Upgrades<\/a> early.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"\/en\/card\/04015\">Jackson Howard<\/a> is obviously always good, but can do some work, finding the pieces you are missing (the right piece of ICE, <a href=\"\/en\/card\/05015\">Mushin No Shin<\/a> or even <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02011\">Mandatory Upgrades<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>Regarding the selection of ICE i didn't mention so far, those are meant to make runs on centrals as taxing as possible. <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02110\">Eli 1.0<\/a> is obioulsy pretty good at taxing the runner, as is <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01062\">Ichi 1.0<\/a> and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/03019\">Viktor 2.0<\/a>. <a href=\"\/en\/card\/05025\">Rainbow<\/a> is a relatively new addition to the deck but i really love it. It cannot be broken without an ICE-Breaker via clicks (which makes it better on HQ to protect against AS) and it's taxing later on, no matter what Breaker the runner uses. <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01064\">Rototurret<\/a> can sometimes be devastating and is a good ICE to put an archives, if necessary.<\/p>\n\n<p>Current Version:<\/p>\n\n<p>Out:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>-2 Shipment from SanSan<\/li>\n<li>-2 Cerebral Overwriter<\/li>\n<li>-1 Heimdall 2.0<\/li>\n<li>-1 Viktor 1.0<\/li>\n<li>-1 Tollbooth<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>In:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>+2 Project Junebug<\/li>\n<li>+1 Hive<\/li>\n<li>+1 Melange Mining Corp.<\/li>\n<li>+1 Eli 1.0<\/li>\n<li>+2 Viktor 2.0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","username":"JackMade","cards":{"01054":1,"01055":3,"01056":3,"01057":2,"01062":1,"01063":1,"01064":2,"01090":1,"01108":2,"02011":3,"02051":3,"02110":2,"03004":1,"03009":2,"03015":1,"03023":1,"04015":3,"04034":2,"04059":3,"04117":1,"04120":3,"05015":3,"05024":3,"05025":3}},{"id":6168,"name":"Digging In The Dirt v2","creation":"2014-05-28 16:26:33","description":"<p>Dedicated Frame Job\/Blackmail Combo.

A brand new identity and one that requires a brand new approach...and best of all, the new approach is one that forces Corps to change up how they play, which is always good for Runners. The main idea of this deck is to freeload as much as possible. It has little in the way of economy...and it doesn't need it. I've played this deck several times (In proxy, as Upstalk isn't out yet) and driven the Corps absolutely insane each time.<\/p>\n\n<p>Alright, so how does it work? It requires a different mindset of the runner. When you're out of credits...Run! You're making the corp pay for your rig, allowing you to build up AND keep up the pressure at the same time. Inside Man is your crucial card, with replicator as a close second. These two in combination form the economic engine of the deck. Early on, your goal is to install with all the credits you have (replicating out copies of hardware from your deck, thinning it down and making the 2 ofs more likely to appear when you need them). Against every corp but Jinteki, you don't even really need overmind on these runs and can focus on your hardware. The corp will either give you free accesses or they'll rez ice to bounce you, which is free credits to continue assembling your rig. <\/p>\n\n<p>Early game you'll be tolerable, keeping pressure on the corporation and making them spend credits, as you should, but probably won't slide away with more than one agenda. This is exactly contrary to most runner decks these days, which do all the work early and then dig desperately for the final agenda to close. <\/p>\n\n<p>Mid game, though, this deck shines and takes the momentum right out from the Corp's hands. With inside man and replicator, it is supremely easy to play out three R&amp;D interfaces, allowing for very deep digs into the corp's deck. Cyberfeeders, too, hit the board all at once and provide a recurring three credits to get through ice even when you're broke. Omni-drive will provide another, and nets Overmind one more token so that it doesn't count its own memory when you install it. Overmind is ridiculously hard to stop with Nasir behind it. Almost all ice (with the exception of some HB) has less strength than rez cost. Your recurring credits will get you through the small stuff, the large stuff is just an invitation for Crescentus to derez (netting you the mass credits again), and Kati Jones will slowly build a Cache of credits for those occasions where the Corp has played a mega server and all the ice is rezzed, or when you need to install something that inside man can't handle (Xanadu, the toolbox, Femme, ect). When overmind runs low, test run, install another, or scavenge to refresh the counters and set off LLDS processor, to further insulate against big money spends. <\/p>\n\n<p>Weaknesses? A few. For one thing, this deck hates being tagged early. Losing Inside Man slows the rig building, and the deck can't fully shine until things are built. Crash Space serves double duty here, helping to clear tags (Nasir often doesn't have a credit to his name, much less 2) and also protecting against meat damage from Weyland kill combos. Plascrete would be an influence saving change, but loses out on the benefit of tag dumping. <\/p>\n\n<p>Second, Jinteki forces a changes of pace. You're going to be constantly replicating out of your deck, so it's going to get thin fast and there's no room for Levy AR, so far as I've found.This means the deck cannot afford to take net damage casually. Against Jinteki, slow down the early game and get overmind onto the field. Jinteki ice has low strength, so overmind can keep you safe from most of it. You can't stop a determined Jinteki from doing net damage, but if you keep it minimal you can mitigate the danger. <\/p>\n\n<p>You also have two hated pieces of ice (Pop up window is an honorable mention as an annoyance, but overmind goes through it just fine). Wraparound only gives you two credits and can really strain your purse to break without a fracter. Swordsman can wear down your clone chips by killing off overmind every time you want to run. Femme is the answer to both (bypassing and just plain breaking, respectively). <\/p>\n\n<p>Why the weird cards? I admit, I've got some cards in here that haven't been used in a while that might be head scratchers. Scrubber is rarely played even inside Anarch, but its necessary in this deck. Wiley corps will refuse to rez ice on remotes, letting you run into San Sans or Pad campaigns you can't afford to trash (since Nasir usually begins the run so poor). If you then take from Kati and run, they'll rez the ice, replacing your pool with the rez cost and (often enough) deny you again. Scrubber ensures that corp can't usually let you go through by putting most trash costs within your range at 1-2 credits in your pool, and also helps clear out R&amp;D by paying trash costs, allowing deep pulls more frequently to hunt down agendas. <\/p>\n\n<p>Crescentus is obvious for this deck. Use it as you pass through big ice and force them to give you a big check again the next time, or leave it face down. Don't forget you can clone chip it out unexpectedly and really ruin the corps day. LLDS processor boosts what you're already going to have to do, continually 'refreshing' overmind now comes with a 3 strength boost, more than enough to run over most of the ice out there and give you yet another 4 card R&amp;D pull. <\/p>\n\n<p>Some alternative combinations - Deep Red (+3 memory for Caissas, but still unused memory) instead of tool box gives a good reason to play Rooks instead of Xanadu. Clone chip can keep them on the board, but you'll run out of them fast with so many possible targets, but still an arrangement worth trying.<\/p>\n","username":"Amakaze","cards":{"01005":3,"01026":2,"01030":2,"01034":2,"01041":2,"02047":2,"02063":2,"02065":2,"02068":3,"02082":1,"02088":3,"02091":2,"02107":3,"03034":2,"03038":3,"03039":3,"04066":3,"04086":2,"05053":3,"06017":1}},{"id":6184,"name":"Playing with Death","creation":"2014-05-28 20:04:36","description":"<p>My first approach to minimal agenda deck without Jackson Howard  and a bit risky ices.<\/p>\n","username":"Beyo","cards":{"01060":2,"01069":2,"01075":2,"01078":1,"01079":1,"01083":2,"01089":1,"01103":2,"01106":3,"01110":3,"02033":3,"04012":2,"04034":2,"04040":1,"04092":2,"05001":1,"05007":3,"05014":3,"05015":2,"05016":1,"05017":3,"05018":2,"05027":1}},{"id":6185,"name":"ExA.I.le","creation":"2014-05-28 20:38:26","description":"<p>First attempts at making an Exile Chess build.

If the runner triggers this ice then pretty much everything stops them for free, since Nesei will recur their one credit each time, so one is all you need for a 50% success on most cards. The rest of the ice in this set-up tries to force the runner to spend money to break them the old fashioned way. I placed 2 Tenma's in the deck to ensure that Guard, and RSVP stay on the outermost spot at all times. <\/p>\n\n<p>For money I went with Subliminal for gaining the extra buck each turn to keep the system ticking, Milange to draw out runs or make a quick 7, and Precog to try and draw them up to the surface and stack agendas. The traps are in there to keep the runner guessing about where the Milange might be and shock goes quickly to the archive for Susanoo-No-Mikoto for a late game remote ice.<\/p>\n\n<p>The rest is pretty straight forward with a heavy emphasis on the Psi abilities or comboing off of RSVP. I really like having Cerebral Cast and placed two SE in there for the quick kill and a Closed Accounts to slow the runner down.

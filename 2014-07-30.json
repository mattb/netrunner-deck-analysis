Priority number one is to get your <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02049\">Personal Workshop<\/a> and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/03049\">Professional Contacts<\/a> chugging away. As long you have something hosted on the Workshop (aka the Bank of Nasir) you've given yourself a safe place to dump your money and advance your rig before your credit pool resets. Make a run, corp rezzes ice, spend your money in pocket on whatever is on Workshop, and then gain a new credit pool from the encounter.<\/p>\n\n<p>The problems then becomes what to do after your credit pool resets and you're now left to encounter a potentially nasty piece of ice, and for that I've built this deck around recurring credits used specifically for icebreakers. <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01041\">The Toolbox<\/a> and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/03041\">Cloak<\/a>, once all online, will provide you with 5c per turn to be used during runs. In earlier versions of the deck, I packed in 3x <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01005\">Cyberfeeder<\/a>, but I found the extra recurring credits weren't worth the deck space and 3 influence. I reworked a few cards and got 2x <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01008\">Datasucker<\/a>, which once stocked with tokens, essentially act as recurring credits as well as pairing well with <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01012\">Parasite<\/a> to nuke ice standing in your way. Don't be afraid to SMC out a Datasucker if you're comfortable with your current breakers, because it will only pay off more the longer its on the table.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"\/en\/card\/03044\">Cyber-Cypher<\/a> is your star breaker here. I use the two of them to lock down centrals as quickly as I can, and if I need to later in the game, I <a href=\"\/en\/card\/03034\">Scavenge<\/a> one or the other to allow it to attack other servers. It's ideal though if they sit on HQ and R&amp;D while you rely on <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01043\">Gordian Blade<\/a> to fill in the gaps.<\/p>\n\n<p>Your <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02022\">Liberated Accounts<\/a> and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01053\">Armitage Codebustings<\/a> are to be used sparingly, and they will do the most work for you in the late game once the corp has rezzed most of its ice. You won't need them in the early game, even the mid, because up until that point, you should be using the corp's money to get your rig set up through your Personal Workshop. Keep your late-game econ cards in your hand if you think you can spare the room, or get them on the table and save them for later if you can't. Just be extra wary of taking tags and having them cleared.<\/p>\n\n<p>On another program-related note, I've toyed around a lot with <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02065\">Crescentus<\/a> and the likes, and its cohort <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01020\">Forged Activation Orders<\/a>, and I've found any form of ice manipulation to be underwhelming. It relies on too many factors. Is the ice a high enough rez cost to be worth using Crescentus on? Is Crescentus even on the table? If I derez the ice, how likely is the corp to just trash it altogether and replace it with something I haven't seen yet? Am I ready if he does that? Even <a href=\"\/en\/card\/06018\">Social Engineering<\/a>, a card that seems custom-tailored to Nasir, is so situational that it ends up being useless the majority of the time: first click only, so you have to hold it a turn, it costs 2c, and then the corp laughs as you approach the ice you've marked, and they say \"yeah, no rez.\"<\/p>\n\n<p>I don't know whether it's been an issue of people not putting together decks that synergize with Nasir's ID, but I don't think he plays as differently as everyone seems to think he does. A lot of the criticism I've seen leveled has been from people operating under the assumption you could plop his ID in a CT or Mac deck and expect it to run just fine. I've played a lot of games with a number of Nasir decks on OCTGN, and this is the one I've started to see a lot of success with.

I generally play my other remotes (<a href=\"\/en\/card\/01109\">PAD Campaign<\/a>, <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04054\">Sundew<\/a>, <a href=\"\/en\/card\/05009\">Mental Health Clinic<\/a>, and even <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04015\">Jackson Howard<\/a>) without ice and rely on high trash costs and the click\/cash intensity of running against Replicating Perfection. <\/p>\n\n<p>How the runner beats this deck:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Early game aggression against R&amp;D. Answer: Put a <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01061\">Heimdall 1.0<\/a> or <a href=\"\/en\/card\/03015\">Heimdall 2.0<\/a> on R&amp;D.

Answer: Put a single piece of ice in front of your Sundews after they pull this trick. <a href=\"\/en\/card\/05025\">Rainbow<\/a> and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02110\">Eli 1.0<\/a> work very well as taxing one-offs. Secondary answer: Keep your <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02029\">Encryption Protocol<\/a> facedown until pay window 4.3. Tax them that extra credit.

Chum is for your scoring server. It\u2019s taxing and dangerous if they\u2019re not running the full suite. <\/li>\n<li>Why <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01113\">Wall of Static<\/a>? Because it costs 2 credits with Corroder. <\/li>\n<li><a href=\"\/en\/card\/05025\">Rainbow<\/a>? Really? Yes! Because Corroder, Gordian Blade, Garrote: 3 credits<\/li>\n<li>Why the operation split? <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01110\">Hedge Fund<\/a> for early game, <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04012\">Celebrity Gift<\/a> for midgame (show them that <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01070\">Snare!<\/a>), <a href=\"\/en\/card\/05026\">Diversified Portfolio<\/a> for six or more credits in the late game. <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p><em>Do not<\/em> install an agenda outside of your scoring server unless you think you can sneak the <a href=\"\/en\/card\/05006\">Philotic Entanglement<\/a> out as if it were an asset.

The lone copy of Celebrity Gift is staying a one-of, as the deck requires you to protect your hand to keep the element of surprise alive. I should also note that the deck is not meant to be competitive, I was bored and wanted to make a fun deck. Anyway, enjoy!<\/p>\n","username":"WardOfTheWoods","cards":{"01069":2,"01090":1,"01100":3,"01103":2,"01110":3,"01111":1,"02033":2,"02060":1,"03026":1,"04012":1,"04034":2,"04074":1,"04077":1,"04092":2,"04114":2,"04117":2,"04119":3,"05003":1,"05005":3,"05007":3,"05014":3,"05015":2,"05017":2,"05018":2,"05023":2,"06003":2}},{"id":8108,"name":"Cold hard cash.","creation":"2014-07-30 23:22:41","description":"<p>This deck has simple goals: Set up lots of ice, get cash often, score agendas somewhere in the mid-to-late-game range.

(don't knock it till you try it!)","creation":"2014-07-30 23:55:13","description":"<p>First off, all credit to PeekaySK for the core concept of this deck (found here: http:\/\/netrunnerdb.com\/en\/decklist\/808\/big-girls-play-with-monoliths) It's an awesome deck that plays fundamentally different from any other runner deck I know of, and it's a lot of fun.  <\/p>\n\n<p>(For detailed info on the basic mechanics of the deck, please check out the original deck; he goes into a lot of detail, especially in the first few few comments, and debunks a lot of the \"improvements\" people suggest that actually go against the core concept of the deck.)<\/p>\n\n<p>I've been playing this deck a lot, and with a lot of variations on the idea, and having varying levels of success.  I've been looking for a viable alternative to Siphons, and Leprechaun finally provided the opening I needed; while I don't even play it some games, it opens up your options <em>immensely<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>New cards in the mix:<\/p>\n\n<p>Self modifying code makes it all possible, as usual. Great for early aggression if needed (though don't spend all your money on it!), great for pulling up your singleton copies of splashed cards, and synergizes great late game with leprechaun (where its two memory cost isn't a problem anymore!). Basically it artificially \"thins\" this already very thin deck so you always have the card you need when you need it.<\/p>\n\n<p>Sneakdoor Beta: a singleton I've wanted in this deck since I first played it, I never had the memory space for it before leprechaun solved that problem.  I love to pull this late game with a SMC and get 4 free nerve agent runs on HQ before they even know what hit them!<\/p>\n\n<p>Knight: with cloak-and-dagger gone mimic was having trouble with all the heavy lifting, sentry-wise.  While I often use atman for real trouble sentries, knight fill this role perfectly (especially if I don't have 9 to spend on a flare atman), and is very cheap and flexible besides.<\/p>\n\n<p>What's gone:<\/p>\n\n<p>Account Siphon: I don't know about y'all, but in my area people seem to plan for siphon no matter the runner ID; and why wouldn't they? I just realized I was able to use it <em>so<\/em> rarely, and even when I did I usually wished I has drawn something else anyways.  dropping freed more card slots for programs (ideal for this deck) and a mountain of influence to spend on new toys!  As a side bonus, I now rarely need to go tag-me, meaning the second plascrete may be unnecessary; maybe another leprechaun?  I've also had fantasies of making Chakana work; probably not though.<\/p>\n\n<p>Cloak and Dagger: I wanted to like these cards, I really did! In the end it was just <em>so many<\/em> card slots and memory for a fairly mediocre sentry breaker.  SMC and a suite of more flexible programs has served me so much better.<\/p>\n\n<p>unnecessary cards: with SMC in the deck, I could afford to slim down on magnum opii, and net shield was an eternal under-performer with all the draw and monolith protection already built in.<\/p>\n","username":"voltorocks","cards":{"01007":2,"01011":2,"01028":1,"01034":3,"01043":3,"01044":2,"01050":3,"02009":2,"02041":1,"02046":1,"02087":3,"02107":2,"03033":3,"03035":3,"03036":2,"03040":2,"03046":3,"04043":2,"06019":1}}]

Despite looking really simple, it was actually great fun!\nThis deck only does 3 things: Score agenda's, make money and build a huge wall in the meantime. \nDuring the whole five rounds I've hardly had any money problems. Especially after a few celebrity gifts and successful demonstrations. The large amounts of reasonably cheap ice makes rezzing lots of ice early game not really an issue. For me the sweet spot was 3 layers of ice on HQ, R&amp;D and 1 remote. Less ice on another remote and archives. Usually this is all set up pretty fast. After that it's a race against the clock.<\/p>\n\n<p>This deck is strong early and mid game. This is because essentially you've got a free turn and with 21 pieces of ice it's not hard to get at least 2 ice in your starting hand. Usually I had at least 2 (less than 2 means a mulligen).\nOnce the mid game passes the runner gets a really big upperhand and all the ice isn't too hard to get through. This isn't fast advance, but with 5x 3\/2 agendas it doesn't go slow either.<\/p>\n\n<p>EDIT: I took absolutely no tracer or bad pub ice because it has no place in this deck. Money is for rezzing my ice and scoring agendas (except Ichi, but he is there for trashing programs). Bad pub means the runner can go through my cheaper ice for free.\nArchived Mem and Vitruvius is used for Celeb gift and SanSan.<\/p>\n\n<p>Notes: <\/p>\n\n<p>-Heimdall I still find really iffy. It looks all impressive, but really isn't hard to get through. I do still need at least a few late game ICE to make it harder for the runner later on.<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>I'm going to replace Enigma with Quandry once it's out. <\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>I'm convinced that once more NEXT ice comes out, this deck will really start rolling. <\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>I've only played 8 times with this deck.

Plascrete can nullify partially. If PSF is scored, focus on those and then SE the runner.<br><br>4\\ Program destruction : Useful again noise and criminal.

With a single credit, you can score astroscript or beale from unadvanced. With an astroscript counter, you can score a 3\/2 with zero credits. With a sansan, you can score almost anything in the deck for the cost of a single shipment. Breaking news from hand cold with zero credits, which won me a game by itself. <br><br>Sure, it only 'nets' you two credits, but thats only part of the story.

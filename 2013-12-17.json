The deck is a rush deck that forces early agendas. The main idea is to force the scoring either of a Mandatory Upgrades or an Accelerated Beta Test. It is crucial to lay down an agenda on the remote server you will create from the free ice and then advance it. Most of the times, it is actually good to activate the Accelerated Beta Test ability since the ice density of the deck is pretty heavy.

It's obvious, the first thing that comes to mind is to make rez very hard for the runner. There are some cards like: Xanadu and Rook that works good for this, and also anothers that may be great for this strategy: Vamp, Emergency Shutdown and Crescentus, the first to ruin the runner, and the others for some unrezzed ices Hueber rezzed before.\nWell up here, the problem is the lack of synergy in this deck, because Djinn doesn't interact with caissas and the only cards that can do this are in shaphers, and here comes the second problem: the lack of influence. To solve this point, I thought of cards like: Self-modifying Code and Quality Time, that allowing me to find programs and Vamp quickly (more or less)\nOn economic issues: Liberated Account and Kati Jones, the first provides me large amounts of credits fast (+ Sure Gamble), and the other will accumulate the credits needed to vamp.\nFinally, to say that there are no Plascrete because the idea is not to run until you have vamp startegy in hand also we have infiltration with Knight and Crypsis+Datasucker for it (always grabbing tags).\nThe idea is vamp the runner economy, and do it again with Same Old Thing or another vamp so that the runner can not lift head and pay his ices.<\/p>\n","username":"Freeman 1.0","cards":{"01002":2,"01008":1,"01009":2,"01010":1,"01012":2,"01049":2,"01050":2,"01051":1,"02021":3,"02022":3,"02043":2,"02065":2,"02082":2,"02087":3,"02091":3,"03046":2,"03054":3,"04002":2,"04003":3,"04041":1,"04042":2,"04043":2}},{"id":1016,"name":"WholeRD Shutdown","creation":"2013-12-17 10:32:39","description":"<p>Rush through deck piling up money and key cards,\nwhen $corp > 11+$runner<\/p>\n\n<p>click : PowerShutdown dumps R&amp;D in Archives<\/p>\n\n<p>click : Install Jackson, <\/p>\n\n<p>activate Jackson, place SEA Source and 2 Scorched Earth in R&amp;D<\/p>\n\n<p>click : Accelerated Diagnostics<\/p>\n","username":"r00k","cards":{"01058":2,"01083":3,"01086":1,"01093":1,"01098":3,"01099":3,"01110":3,"01112":3,"02037":3,"02039":3,"02077":3,"02120":1,"04015":3,"04019":2,"04040":3,"04052":3,"04058":3,"04060":3}},{"id":1017,"name":"Supermodernism Accelerated vHJ1.0","creation":"2013-12-17 12:37:36","description":"<p>My upgrade of the supermodernism deck.

If opponent has a decoy out that shuts down the sea source but mid seasons will still blow past it usually. 3 chimera to keep the runner out of HQ (AS\/Vamp\/Gabe\/etc) as long as it can. Combo requires 10c (sea source. At least 6+ more than runner) or 13c (mid seasons) if you can tag the runner with a SS in hand and with JackHo already in play, it's still 13c if you need all 3 SE, otherwise you can add a hedge fund\/beanstalk to burst you up to enough creds.

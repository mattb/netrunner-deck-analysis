I'm trying a new concept of running 59 cards. I have the same amount of agendas I would in a 49 card deck but the extra ten cards makes it harder to dig for the runner. (20% of deck is agenda vs 25% in 49) I advance behind big ice (oversight AI\/BER) using zed, ice wall, and other cheap ice for inside job protection. I'm still vulnerable to shutdown but breaking\/killing the ice should be very difficult\/expensive. I have the ability to FA with biotic labor and haas arcology. Haas arcology also gives me the ability to bluff an agenda forcing the player to spend money running or giving me the extra clicks. Zed is underated IMO (I haven't seen him played but I understand why in a 49 card deck) as his ability is strong for 2 rez cost. The combo isn't reliable on paper but as I play test I'll know whether it's worth it. A Zed\/Ichi 1.0 or Viktor 2.0 could be a strong surprise for runners. Even with a faerie out, It just makes ZED become a \"trash faerie\" ice. I'm OK with that. Profiteering makes the runner fear a hard rez on Janus as Jackson Howard lets me dig through the deck and Melange does its thing behind a secure remote forcing the runner to burn money getting to it. As always, constructive criticism is welcome.

But it is the grass that hides the viper from his enemies and shelters him until he strikes.\"\n- Doran Martell, A Dance with Dragons<\/p>\n\n<p>This is the Cerebral Imaging deck that I finished in 5th place with at the Arlington Plugged-In stop. The goal is to stockpile credits and cards in HQ while turtling ice on the central servers, until you amass an 11-card 13-credit combo that allows you to score 7 agenda points in a single turn. It sounds ridiculous, but I have successfully triggered the one-turn combo in 8 of my last 12 games with this deck, including 2 of 4 rounds during Plugged-In amid the top tables. It's a very fun deck to play that catches people by surprise.<\/p>\n\n<p>Due to formatting issues, the cards required to start the combo and the combo itself are posted here now: http:\/\/www.boardgamegeek.com\/blogpost\/25805\/dorans-blades<\/p>\n\n<p>There's many, many different slight combinations of these cards possible. I haven't seen this particular combo posted anywhere yet, it was developed just by playing the deck and it was the easiest for me to memorize. The easiest variation to it is working a third Biotic Labor and one of your Archived Memories into the mix. The Trick of Lights and Shipment from Kaguyas are typically the last piece of the puzzle that you're rapidly drawing cards to find. In my second round game that I won at Plugged-In, I had a SfK in the last three cards in R&amp;D. In my third round game that I won, that third SfK was in the last ten cards in R&amp;D. In both games, I ended up using a third Biotic Labor and Archived Memories to pull one of the used SfKs back into hand from Archives.. that variation is a 12-card combo that requires 17 credits.<\/p>\n\n<p>One of my concerns with bringing this type of deck into the tournament environment was time. With 60-minute rounds, not a single one of my four rounds went to time, and only one came close... three of my rounds were complete prior to hitting the 45-minute mark. Private Contracts probably looks like an odd splash, but my winning percentage with the deck has turned around since including it. I typically install it on my final click, in a new remote server unprotected by ice. The runner will almost always run it. If they trash it, then I spent a click and a card to make them lose five credits, no complaints there. If they don't trash it, then I can rez at the start of my turn and pull from it three times... the equivalent of spending three clicks to draw three credits, which happens commonly enough with this deck anyway. At that point, most runners will run and trash it, knowing they can't afford to let it stick around with my deck. Still a net gain in my opinion, as I gained credits and forced them to spend a decent amount. Some runners will let it sit, not content to spend 5 credits to prevent me from gaining the remaining 8. That gives me the option of gaining 6 credits immediately, letting it sit as Account Siphon\/Vamp recovery for a later turn, or just take credits off it occasionally as necessary.<\/p>\n\n<p>Ice is a bit tricky with this deck, and I'm still experimenting with the ice a lot. Since all of your influence is spent on combo cards (yes, Ice Wall is part of that combo in this deck) and Jackson Howard, you're stuck with in-house or neutral ice in this build. My goal is to spend as little money as possible rezzing while taxing the runner as much as possible. With just 9 agendas, quickly drawing most of those agendas into HQ, and then protecting the HQ agendas with sheer numbers, you don't have to worry about the occasional access here and there. My goal is to limit those accesses as cheaply as I can, as I don't have the money or ice to attempt to prevent accesses altogether. Minelayer works beautifully, either getting rid of ice install costs (which adds up quite a lot when you're only icing central servers) or forcing Runners to break it. The NEXT suite of ice will work great in this deck once more of them are available; cheap to rez and an ideal amount of strength in number. In the meantime, the cheaper bioroids are probably your best bet for saving you some money and still forcing them to spend clicks and\/or credits. Restructure will obviously fit into this deck quite nicely, once available. I have begun testing new iterations and will publish updates once I'm content with the changes.<\/p>\n","username":"CrimsonWraith","cards":{"01055":2,"01058":3,"01059":3,"01060":2,"01062":1,"01063":1,"01064":1,"01100":3,"01103":3,"01106":2,"01110":3,"02020":1,"02033":2,"02051":2,"02052":1,"02059":3,"02070":3,"02110":2,"03001":1,"03005":3,"03014":2,"03018":3,"04015":3}},{"id":522,"name":"Anti Environment","creation":"2013-11-13 23:49:27","description":"Deck made for local tournament heavy in fast advance and tag and bag.","username":"Gakochun","cards":{"01004":1,"01007":1,"01021":2,"01023":1,"01026":2,"01033":1,"01034":3,"01035":3,"01036":3,"01039":3,"01043":2,"01044":1,"02025":1,"02028":3,"02047":3,"02048":1,"02069":3,"02088":3,"02107":3,"03037":1,"03038":2,"03046":2,"03055":1}}]

This 3-point agenda build though, seems really really solid. <\/p>\n\n<p>I had the idea to build a medtech-glacier deck after fiddling around with my replicating perfection deck, which is still unbeaten. Instead of relying on traps and mushin no shin shenaningans i built this deck as a classic scoring-server deck and playtesting so far has shown, that this idea is indeed not too bad. (7-2 stats)<\/p>\n\n<p>So what do we have in here?\nFirst of all the agenda mix: \nAs you see there is nothing too fancy about it. Future Perfects are your agenda buffer, to make stealing one as hard as possible. You mainly want to score those priority requistions, which have the nice side effect of letting you rez an expensive ice for free - and we have lots of expensive ice in here!<\/p>\n\n<p>Assets:\nAs soon as your scoring server has at least one big ice in front of it you can start using GRNDL refineries to either let the runner waste his credits on a tollbooth and afterwards only trash the refinery or to get a huge amount of credits on your next turn. <\/p>\n\n<p>Jackson helps to get everything you need and can also support you on getting rid of a hand full of agendas. <\/p>\n\n<p>The mining corps are another way to effectively use your scoring server for protection and get lots of money the next turn. <\/p>\n\n<p>Shock is in there to give a possible kill on reckless runners who don't want to jack out after a komainu. Also, because of the taxing nature of this deck, there will appear situations, in which the runner isn't even able to trash it from rnd or hq. <\/p>\n\n<p>Caprice Nisei:\nYeah, Jintekis most beloved clone detective... nothing else to say here ;)<\/p>\n\n<p>Operations:\nAll operations are mainly eco-based and help you to recover from paying for exp. ice or an account siphon. Closed Accounts gives siphon + tag me-runners a bad time and fast track is just there to get your second prio req, if you can't seem to find it. <\/p>\n\n<p>ICE:\nThe ice mixture is mainly about taxing (yagura, pup, komainu, inazuma, snowflake in front of rnd) and keeping the runner out (tollbooth, tsurugi, inazuma, wall of thorns, snowflake either on hq or on your remote). I would also recommend to get one really expensive ice in front of your archives against most runners, because of stuff like security testing, data sucker, sneakdoor beta and so on). <\/p>\n\n<p>If you draw it, guard can be used as the outermost piece of ice on your remote, so the runner can't inside job anymore. Also a swordsman can help out on the remote, especially against runners using the central breaker-suite with a back up crypsis\/ overmind\/ knight (which is fairly common in the meta right now). <\/p>\n\n<p>Yeah, i am pretty happy with this deck right now.

My n0ise deck can't benefit currently from any more tweaks and since it's a competitive powerhouse, I turned around to play something a bit more different. <\/p>\n\n<p>I'm not gonna lie, a big part of picking up Exile is because he is one of the most underplayed identities and I wanted to make <strong>something cool, fun and that works<\/strong>. I've found myself with really great deck, which I believe with the right finishing tweaks might even reach competitive level. <\/p>\n\n<p><em>While brainstorming<\/em> I came up with a bunch of cool and original decks that use a lot of H&amp;P, including a <strong>Overmind<\/strong> with <strong>Oracle May<\/strong>,  <strong>Motivation<\/strong>  - connection deck, <strong>however<\/strong> after I'm done around 80-90%  with the deck I realize that if I <strong>simply switch Exile for Kate<\/strong> the deck won't work any different <strong>except being tons of more efficient<\/strong>.  It's just so hard to make a deck that's catered towards Exile, before any other Shaper.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>In my mind<\/strong> currently there are only <strong>2<\/strong> decks that it makes a difference if you play Exile, rather any other Shaper. The first one is with <em>Pawn+Deep Red+ Scheherazade<\/em> combo and the second one is <em>like this one, where the heap becomes your hand<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now with this big intro out of the way, we can start!<\/p>\n\n<h2>General Mindset()<\/h2>\n\n<p>The deck relies <strong>heavily<\/strong> on a couple of card interactions and ideas and it's very important to master them if you want to use this deck efficiently (even I'm still getting used to them)<\/p>\n\n<h3>Diesel+QT+Freelance<\/h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>If you <strong>ever<\/strong> want to play Freelance coding, this is the correct way to do it in my opinion - with a lot of programs and a lot of draw. Your first couple of turns, you would want to <em>chain<\/em> card draw into programs into free lance, while leaving in hand <strong>test run+ scavenge<\/strong> , <strong>memory<\/strong> and <strong>clone chips<\/strong>.  I feel the only <strong>dead<\/strong> condition for this deck is if your 3x Freelance are stuck together somewhere in the mid\/bottom of your deck. So make sure you shuffle your deck properly!<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>A normal starting hand for you will be either Diesel+ QT+ Freelance (optimal), or Diesel\/QT + Freelance, or Diesel+QT (double draw) .... often another draw will pop in those cards and you <strong>most likely want to play it if u dont have free lance drawn yet or\/and 5 programs<\/strong>.  <\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>If you end up with a hand of 10-to-15 cards  on your turn 1 or 2- <strong>you are doing stuff right<\/strong>! <\/p>\n\n<p><em>Note<\/em>: If I had the opportunity I'd play with 20 programs rather than 18. I feel 17 is the absolute minimum for an efficient Freelance Coding deck. If you have 15 (which is still a relatively large count in normal decks), that means that you will have <strong>only 3<\/strong> possibilities to chain Freelance for 5 cards. Exactly 3x5. The chances of that happening are <strong>very low<\/strong>. With 20 programs though, I'd hit 2x Freelance for 5 cards <strong>easy<\/strong>. However, AS is just too much of a strong card and it makes <strong>big impact<\/strong> in the deck, so I had to make room for it and sadly there isn't much else to go. <\/p>\n\n<h3>Test Run+Scavenge<\/h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Now once your programs are in the heap\/dumpster you would want to test run+ scavange for <strong>your expensive breakers<\/strong> or <strong>magnum opus<\/strong>. Now <em>here<\/em> is where Exile shines over Kate for <strong>this type of deck<\/strong>.  After all the Diesel and the QT are done and Kate doesn't have her Memory items or Clone chips (about that read bellow) she might need to spend 1 or 2 complete turns going for 1 card per click draw. Exile, however,  gain on instant speed 2 cards each time he TR+S combo, <strong>which makes the deck a lot faster and helps him finish up his rig sooner<\/strong>. <\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>When the pace of the game allows it (to spend 1 entire turn without running) TR for Magnum Opus, gain 4c and scavenge it at the 4th click. That's pretty efficient install, considering it lowers the install cost by 2, Magnum Nets u 2c on Freelance coding it, you immediately net 1 more than the install cost(with 2nd and 3rd clicks) and with the scavenge on 4th click you leave it in play. <strong>Oh yeah, because you are exile you gain 2 cards on instant speed as well<\/strong>. Pretty efficient, 'aint it! =) <\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<h3>Clone chip+MU<\/h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Your rig is very MU expensive. I've tried a couple of variation with Akematsu Mem chips and having programs that trash themselves after usage like Cresentus and Faerie, however I didn't end up liking them. So last week I decided to go for the <em>big guys<\/em> from CyberSolution Mem chips and it turned out to be a <strong>great fit for the programs that I wanted to run<\/strong>.  <\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Your rig would be something like Magnum (2MU), Keyhole (2MU), 3 breakers (3MU) that's alread 7 MU gone and with the rest 3 (considering u have all 3 chips in) you can\/have to setup 2 Femme's and 1 Nerve agent. Or some AI breaker that gets you efficient somewhere. <\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Clone chips are important as well. Use them to recur programs and <strong>that's why there are cheap breakers in the mix as well<\/strong> like sharpshooter, mimic, gordian , corroder ... because tempo is very important for this deck( gonna explain bellow), sometimes you can't wait to TR+S a femme\/torch and u need to get past that quandary ASAP! Also you can recur Deus Ex before hitting some Jinteki traps and you can Sharpshooter into any scary destroyer (once SS is in the heap). <strong>They are a big reason<\/strong> for your heap literally being your hand, because you can fetch any solution at instant speed, once you've already <em>Freelance-d<\/em> it.<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<h3>Late Game Goals<\/h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>If you reach end game, there is <strong>almost nothing the corp can do<\/strong>. You have sustain econ (Magnum Opus), you have all breakers, you have Keyhole for R&amp;D <strong>and<\/strong> archive pressure, you have Nerve Agent for HQ pressure and you have Femme's that can get you anywhere. <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<h2>Certain Card Choices()<\/h2>\n\n<h3>Keyhole and Nerve agent<\/h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>These are my late game tools. I wanted to spread the pressure as much as possible and I have the MU to do it.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<h3>Account Siphone<\/h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The deck without it and with it is very different. Not only it will help you get some critical money while setup your rig, but it will also slow down the corp.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<h3>Escher<\/h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>This is another great late game trick and not many people will expect it.

Not only it makes you stop dreading the possibility that a random net damage can discard your Levy (<strong>which you will be using for sure<\/strong>), but it also allows you recur Escher which you didn't have the possibility to play or to AS spam. <strong>Something even I'm getting used to atm<\/strong> is using it to Freelance when I get really unlucky drawing a 2nd one during a <em>chain<\/em>. <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<h3>Overmind\/ Atman\/ Omega<\/h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Are generally program fillers.<strong>You need a high amount of programs so u have a good % to chain free lance for 4-5 cards<\/strong>.

In many cases you won't have the luxury to sit for 2 turns and chaining combos, <strong>or if you get unlucky with the draw<\/strong>. That's when your decision making and skill as a player comes in. You have to know <strong>when<\/strong> to cut and <strong>what<\/strong>. <\/p>\n\n<p>The deck is extremely difficult to play, <strong>simply<\/strong> because you have <strong>too many options<\/strong> at all points of time. Anyway, I wouldn't say it's <strong>competitive strong<\/strong> (yet), but will do some work and it's bound to catch people off-guard, which is always a good thing. <\/p>\n\n<p>P.s. It's  3 AM currently, so I'll fix up and add some stuff tomorrow afternoon. Hope you find it a good read! <\/p>\n\n<p>P.s.s. Before I get asked against fast advance, Mimic + 1x Femme -> 1x The Source + 1x Program , seems like a good fix to me. With so much draw you are bound to get The Source out in the first couple of turns, but 17 programs might lead to low consistency on the Freelance. Something to think about ;)<\/p>\n","username":"Dydra","cards":{"01007":1,"01011":1,"01018":1,"01026":3,"01034":3,"01043":1,"01044":3,"02041":1,"02047":3,"02066":2,"02087":3,"03030":1,"03031":1,"03033":3,"03034":3,"03035":1,"03038":3,"03040":1,"03054":3,"04047":1,"04061":1,"04067":1,"04086":3,"04088":1,"05053":1}},{"id":6126,"name":"I can't come up with a witty name for my NEXT Design deck.","creation":"2014-05-27 20:49:16","description":"<p>So, this is my pet deck that I've been working on for a while. I haven't done that much testing in this final form, but it's been pretty solid so far. It roughly plays like your standard NEXT ICE-heavy deck rush deck, but that often fails due to the inherent randomness in NEXT and ABT. It's the various contingencies that make it shine.<\/p>\n\n<p>AGENDAS:\nThe goal with the agendas is basically that, whichever one you score first -- and you will often score one right off the bat in a server protected by two cheap ICE -- will help you immensely based on its effect alone. <a href=\"\/en\/card\/03023\">Gila Hands Arcology<\/a> works as it always does, being nice reliable economy. <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02011\">Mandatory Upgrades<\/a> is also great, and probably my favorite first agenda. It allows you to transition to fast advance, and set a significant economic advantage. Also da bomb with Melange. <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01055\">Accelerated Beta Test<\/a> is the standard for NEXT. Scoring one can shore up your defenses immensely. <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04010\">Project Ares<\/a> is my most recent breakthrough. It was previous Vitruvius, to recall dumped agendas and be fast-advanceable post ManUp. However, that never really helped me all that much. If I didn't score an early ManUp, Vitruvius was often the last thing I wanted to see. Ares, on the other hand, can change the game. It can basically reset the board. Advance it like a ManUp, and you can reactivate your binary ICE. I'm often scoring a 6-8 advanced Ares, but I will just do it for points if I'm feeling secure. Even if they choose to trash their resources instead of their programs, that's a lot of tempo lost as it can be expensive to go through tons of ICE.<\/p>\n\n<p>ASSETS: <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01108\">Melange Mining Corp.<\/a> is another good option for that early scoring server. Get all the credits you'll ever need while they scramble to get in. Hard rez a Wotan for bonus points. <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01069\">Project Junebug<\/a> and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01057\">Aggressive Secretary<\/a> will save you if you're behind. Either they reactivate your ICE, flatline the runner, or scare them away while you slowly advance big agendas. Each is a 1x, so they're always a surprise.<\/p>\n\n<p>UPGRADES: Mmmm... Ash.<\/p>\n\n<p>OPERATION: Fast economy for lots of first turn rezing. I'm considering finding room for another Beanstalk.<\/p>\n\n<p>ICE: All the cheap ETR ICE! NEXT Silver will eventually go in here, but I don't know where. Notables: <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04117\">Hive<\/a> makes for a super secure scoring server for the first few turns. <a href=\"\/en\/card\/05016\">Inazuma<\/a> is an MVP. Reactivates Rotos, makes Paper Wall hilarious. I'm considering adding a second. Even if I only get it and two other ICE in my opening hand, I'd rather only take the two free installs because it is just so powerful early game. <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02030\">Sherlock 1.0<\/a> is under-rated, IMO. Expensive, yes, but incredibly taxing and can also reset the ICE for a turn or two, if timing is good. <\/p>\n\n<p>PLAYSTYLE: Generally, I want to finish my first turn having played an economy operation, ICE on HQ and R&amp;D, and a scoring server with two ICE and an Agenda (Melange as a runner-up). Enough of the ICE is dirt cheap that you can withstand early pressure. I generally don't put too much effort into protecting R&amp;D off the bat. ICE density is average, but they can't do much else to me. Very little is trash-able. At that point, you want to rush out your next agenda over the following 1-4 turns, depending on how much economy you can manage in face of early aggression. Always fire ABT unless you're in a comfortable position. With 26 ICE you usually get two, and ditching the odd agenda isn't a big deal. The traps are especially useful if they've seen ManUps and Ares. <\/p>\n","username":"Thike","cards":{"01055":3,"01057":1,"01064":3,"01069":1,"01098":2,"01108":3,"01110":3,"02011":3,"02013":2,"02019":2,"02030":1,"02052":2,"02110":3,"03003":1,"03015":1,"03023":2,"04010":3,"04011":3,"04020":1,"04030":1,"04059":3,"04096":1,"04117":1,"04120":3,"05016":1}},{"id":6127,"name":"Ramp Central Control","creation":"2014-05-27 22:16:43","description":"<p>This deck is focused in a central server assault to control de corporation credits. Its played a little like a RUG control from magic. :) Lets talk about the chosen cards:<\/p>\n\n<h2>Green<\/h2>\n\n<p><strong>Quality Time and Diesel<\/strong> = Both cards are your drawing machine. Your central assault rig is cheap enough but you need to get this cards as soon as possible. <\/p>\n\n<h2>Red<\/h2>\n\n<p><strong>Data Leak Reversal<\/strong> = An awesome card that almost works as a R&amp;D multiaccess. Using it together with Fall Guy And Account Siphon is so strong that can almost guarentee a victory.

Got a Closed Accounts? This card and Iain ability put you in your feet in a single click.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Unregistered S&amp;W '35<\/strong> = Caprice Nicei? DEAD. Jackson Howard? DEAD. Chairman Hiro? DEAD too. Shoot'em all dead.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Account Siphon<\/strong> =  Do I really need to talk about it?<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Data Dealer<\/strong> = Sometimes you just need that push to get a more valuable agenda. Sometimes you just want to play safe. And sometimes you just hate too much Shi.Kyu.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Icebreakers<\/h2>\n\n<p>The whole suite is intended to easily access central servers. <strong>Crypsis<\/strong> is there for emergency remote runs.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Gameplay Style<\/h2>\n\n<p>You will start the game trying to fill out your rig. And thats extremly cheap, and gets even easier if the corp just scores a 1pt agenda. This does not mean that you wont do some facechecks...do not let the corp sit down in a huge amout of credits in anyway, if possible. As soon as your rig is ready to play, punish the corp with multiple AS and keep controling the ICE's. A huge thing is, after an AS that removes every single penny from the corp, you install DLR and Fall Guy. This is just too much pain. Against FA decks you dont have too much time, but central assault is huge since almost every ICE will be easy to break. Here are some individual tips:<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Weyland Decks<\/strong> = You know right? Yeah, freaking scorched earth, so get your plascretes ready. Multiple HQ runs is the way to go, keep pushing, do not let this guys rich. Sooner or later one of your programs will be trashed, so get ready to play the long game and even use your cripsys for central assaults too. Lucky for you, the long game is what you are seeking.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>NBN<\/strong> = They will play it fast, so get your rig ready as fast as possible. A logos in your opening hand is a good thing. Closed accounts is not as bad as it seems since you can recover from it quickly with Iain ability and <strong>Security Testing<\/strong>. They can get poor fast too, so keep'em that way.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Jinteki<\/strong> = Net damage is a chore but you will, most of the times, stay with lots of cards on your hand. Get Alias fast, and if they got to second level ICEs, beware of these nasty Code Gates. Harmony medtech is your worst enemy now. Not only there is the fear of flatline, but the damn deck is faster than lightning so prepare to forget about control and push them. The thing is, if you manage to fastly build your rig, everything will be cheap in central server and you can win this. And shot that bitch caprice down for god's sake<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>H&amp;B<\/strong> = They can be fast too, but most of the time they will play the long game. Running Interference is a great tool, specially to get theses advertisings down for good. Controling their credits is hard, but their ICE is expensive, so use Emergency Shutdowns and Forged Activation at your favor.<\/p>\n\n<p>I'm having a moderate amount of suceess with this deck. I think it has potential. I'm still trying to get the hang of it, and I'm still training and seeing what cards are working and what cards are not. Feedback is really appreciated since this is a Work in Progress. I just love this ID and I hope it to find a deck thats tournament playable.<\/p>\n","username":"Diegofsv","cards":{"01018":3,"01020":2,"01031":1,"01034":2,"01050":3,"01051":2,"02009":2,"02043":3,"02085":2,"02087":3,"02103":3,"03054":2,"04044":1,"04106":2,"05028":1,"05033":2,"05037":3,"05039":1,"05041":2,"05042":2,"05046":2,"05048":2}},{"id":6128,"name":"Entropic Recursion","creation":"2014-05-27 22:32:53","description":"<p>As long as you can recur it, Overmind basically just needs money to break things. So, make a lot of money and make it count on big runs on R&amp;D using Indexing or Maker's Eye.<\/p>\n\n<p>Ideal early play: Test Run -> Overmind, Run w\/ Indexing or Makers Eye, maybe Scavenge Overmind to refresh tokens and avoid paying 2 clicks and full retail price.<\/p>\n\n<p>Some of the card choices:<\/p>\n\n<p>CyberSolutions Mem Chip gives more Overmind tokens. With one chip installed, you get 7 tokens; two on the board gets you 9. Due to the recursion, this adds up fast.<\/p>\n\n<p>Scavenge is the main enabler of Overmind recursion, with some early help from Test Run and late help from Levy AR Access. <\/p>\n\n<p>I'm generally not a fan of LLDS Processor, but with a recursive Overmind hitting the board to run a deep r&amp;d server the cost savings and surprise factor is significant. It can also get you in when you otherwise wouldn't be able to. <\/p>\n\n<p>Lucky Find + Power Nap turned out to be a really effective combo. A mid game Power Nap with 4+ doubles in the trash is a nice burst of money..<\/p>\n\n<p>Save Esher for early mid game when R&amp;D is starting to become too expensive to run but HQ is still soft. A good Esher run can open up R&amp;D for several more turns afterwards and put the corp in disarray.<\/p>\n\n<p>Planned Assault is a good problem solver, especially early in the game. Try not to hold it waiting for a later opportunity, just play it as soon as you have enough bank to do something effective. The main scenario: you have Indexing but not Makers Eye in hand or vice versa but you do have Planned Assault; run the one you have and fetch the other with Planned Assault. Previously, it seemed like I was always holding 2 Indexing or 2 Maker's Eye; this card smooths the draw nicely. Situational usage: you see a window of opportunity and Planned Assault into Esher. Secondarily, it also pumps up the payoff for Power Nap.<\/p>\n\n<p>I had Quality Time 3x, but switched to Diesel to save credits and to avoid forced discards. So far it has been a good trade.<\/p>\n\n<p>Do's and Don'ts<\/p>\n\n<p>Do play aggressively, not worrying about holding cards back for the late game. In the mid game when the corps is able to keep you out of R&amp;D for two turns or more at a time, it is a good time to use Levy AR Lab Access to flip the deck and start over to regain momentum. Don't let both copies of Levy AR Lab Access get trashed; one can be recovered from as you'll get it back with the other but if you lose both the deck will sputter out hard in the late game.<\/p>\n\n<p>If LLDS is in play, try to time it to bring Overmind into play the turn you are making a big run to benefit from LLDS (obviously).<\/p>\n\n<p>Try to time it so that you install Parasite <em>after<\/em> you have a fully loaded Overmind in play.<\/p>\n\n<p>Try not to install more than 1 Overmind at a time unless you absolutely need to.<\/p>\n\n<p>Draw draw draw into Professional Contacts. <\/p>\n\n<p>I was running Kati Jones 2x and Hostage 1x for awhile, but Arbitrage is more bursty than Kati which is what this deck needs, and I dropped the Hostage for a 2nd Parasite.<\/p>\n\n<p>Inti is in the deck solely in case the corp is using Wraparound; otherwise do not bother playing it.<\/p>\n\n<p>Don't waste Parasite too early. It is needed to kill annoying \/ problem ice such as Swordsman (!), or low strength \/ many routines ice like Tsurugi and Komainu that cost a disproportionate number of Overmind tokens or annoying traces such as Shadow. Things like Pup or Pop-up window that don't have to be broken and can be cheaply paid off can be ignored. Data Raven and Tollbooth can be problematic as well due to their non-breakable abilities; in a longer game they are decent targets but usually it is more expedient to Esher them onto servers you don't care about.<\/p>\n\n<p>If you suspect tag + bag, don't let the corps get 18 credits ahead of you and hold enough bits back.to beat midseason's trace.<\/p>\n","username":"KillerShrike","cards":{"01012":2,"01034":3,"01036":3,"01053":2,"02046":1,"02047":2,"02106":3,"03031":1,"03034":3,"03035":2,"03048":1,"03049":2,"04066":3,"04086":2,"04107":3,"04109":3,"05036":2,"05053":3}},{"id":6129,"name":"Beginner Kate Test","creation":"2014-05-27 22:57:45","description":"<p>FOR KEVIN'S EYES ONLY<\/p>\n","username":"RightSaidKevin","cards":{"01012":1,"01018":1,"01033":1,"01034":3,"01036":3,"01037":3,"01041":2,"01042":3,"01043":3,"01044":2,"01046":3,"01050":3,"02009":2,"02091":2,"02108":2,"03038":3,"03040":3,"03046":3,"03049":2,"03054":2}},{"id":6130,"name":"HB Mushin\/Program Trash","creation":"2014-05-27 23:25:38","description":"\n","username":"Nobo715","cards":{"01054":1,"01057":2,"01058":3,"01064":3,"01065":2,"01069":1,"01110":3,"01113":3,"02011":3,"02051":3,"02070":3,"03023":2,"04010":3,"04011":3,"04020":2,"04058":2,"04090":3,"05015":3,"05016":2,"05024":3}},{"id":6131,"name":"1984 v0.2","creation":"2014-05-27 23:35:51","description":"<p>A few small changes here.

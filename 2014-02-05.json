So, much like the general consesus is, his money is spent to summon breakers before the ice rez, and use the rez money to pay for the break.

Its a light eco deck because, after you're set, everything is almost free. Here is how it works.<\/p>\n\n<p>First thing you want is a Replicator. After you install it, ALWAYS get another hardware copy, even useless one. It thins your deck and leaves what you need, and works beautifully with Capstone. After that get a LLDS and install all 3 of it.This is the base of your RIG so everytime you install an icebreaker, he will be with at least +3 str (Dino will make it +5). Do not be afraid to change your already installed Inti your ZU, scavenge em, test run it from the archives and next turn buy it and install them again. When every tutor is gone, go for Levy and stay using capstone to remove any useles card buy your icebreakers again. Scheherazade is great here. Its a beautiful thing have a 5 str faerie that gives you 1 cred. Feedback is always welcome.<\/p>\n","username":"Diegofsv","cards":{"01019":3,"01050":3,"02007":3,"02047":3,"02048":2,"02088":3,"02104":3,"03030":1,"03034":3,"03035":2,"03038":3,"03046":3,"03048":3,"03049":3,"04022":3,"04066":3,"04068":3}},{"id":2000,"name":"Noise hard at work","creation":"2014-02-05 23:31:29","description":"<p>Ok there is a lot of haters for Hard at Work (HaW). I think the card is pretty good and will get better when the new deluxe expansion comes out. Why? Run events like Early Bird are huge in this type of deck. The run events help to keep the pressure on the corp. Cool card interactions is you will always have money to run using any of the run events if you have HaW in play. Armitage is present to help burst your econ when you need it to install a breaker like Yog or the A.I.

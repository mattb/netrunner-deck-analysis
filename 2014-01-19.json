I removed chakana, I really liked the idea but I needed some card draw boost. In its place I added some diesel, you can't go wrong with diesel. Also, I found out that emergency shutdown was't that good in a deck that doesn't have a lot of incentive to run HQ, so I removed it and added 2 parasites and a ninja. The ninja I added because I needed a cheaper sentry breaker. I added Ninja and not Mimic because ninja, hosted in the Dino, can kill an archer with 7$. I'm thinking of adding Garrote but the 3 influence is a problem. The parasites are a lot of fun to use with shapers. Even without parasites, I can leave them on an annoying piece of ice and even kill a couple outright, even in the middle of a run. Lastly I removed an R&amp;D interface and added a third Scavenge. This is the only change I'm still not very sure about. I felt that I needed some more scavenges, both for redirecting Femme and Cybercyfers and to test run-scavenge Torch. I'll see how that goes.<\/p>\n","username":"PsymonTheWizard","cards":{"01012":2,"01026":1,"01027":1,"01034":2,"01037":3,"01042":1,"01053":2,"02047":3,"02048":2,"02065":3,"02091":2,"02107":2,"03028":1,"03031":1,"03034":3,"03035":1,"03038":3,"03039":2,"03044":2,"03046":3,"03049":2,"03053":3,"04047":1}},{"id":1555,"name":"OCTGN test deck- Criminal","creation":"2014-01-19 02:59:59","description":"\n","username":"katie329","cards":{"01010":1,"01018":2,"01019":3,"01020":2,"01021":2,"01022":2,"01023":1,"01024":1,"01025":2,"01026":2,"01027":2,"01028":1,"01030":1,"01038":3,"01049":3,"01050":3,"01051":1,"01052":1,"01053":3,"02005":2,"02006":1,"02064":1,"02065":2,"02066":1,"02091":1,"03041":2,"03042":1,"03052":2,"03053":1,"03054":2,"04005":1,"04024":1,"04026":1,"04029":2,"05030":1}},{"id":1556,"name":"OCTGN test deck- Criminal","creation":"2014-01-19 03:04:25","description":"\n","username":"katie329","cards":{"01010":1,"01017":1,"01018":2,"01019":3,"01020":2,"01021":2,"01022":2,"01023":1,"01024":1,"01025":2,"01026":2,"01027":2,"01028":1,"01030":1,"01038":3,"01049":3,"01050":3,"01051":1,"01052":1,"01053":3,"02005":2,"02006":1,"02064":1,"02065":2,"02066":1,"02091":1,"03041":2,"03042":1,"03052":2,"03053":1,"03054":2,"04005":1,"04024":1,"04026":1,"04029":2}},{"id":1557,"name":"Death by a thousand net damage. v1.2","creation":"2014-01-19 03:15:13","description":"<p>Ok, some rethinks and changes. First of all, I removed the wotan and ichi 2.0 for a third archer and two sansan city grid. My idea for this was that I prefer that I score the agenda in the same turn that I draw it. This also means that there is higher danger for HQ runs now and this is why I added both eli and a 3rd archer. Hokusai city grid is still one of the most useful cards in here and it can be a pain to eat one in the face as you try to access a card from HQ. I removed project junebag and added shock, I find it far more useful since it can do damage from both r&amp;d and HQ. It has a trash cost so it won't go away if accessed from both this locations witch is an added bonus. I swapped swordsman for a Tsurugi, if I find that AIs are such a big problem again I'll swap them back again, but I think that my Ice str disparity is adequate. The swap of two unorthodox predictions for a braintrust was a must since I needed the extra card, If I find it problematic I'll bring them back and I might remove something else. Last I removed the hedge fund for the celebrity gift because I feel that later game intimidation and better profit is preferable to first turn boost. If it doesn't work I'll swap them back in again.<\/p>\n","username":"PsymonTheWizard","cards":{"01067":1,"01070":3,"01072":3,"01075":2,"01077":3,"01078":2,"01092":2,"01101":3,"02014":3,"02032":3,"02080":2,"02095":3,"02110":3,"02112":2,"03023":3,"04012":2,"04032":3,"04054":3,"04073":2,"04074":2}},{"id":1558,"name":"Crimson King v1.0","creation":"2014-01-19 03:46:35","description":"\n","username":"epy0N","cards":{"01002":2,"01003":2,"01006":3,"01007":2,"01008":3,"01010":2,"01011":2,"01012":3,"01014":1,"01018":3,"01050":3,"01053":3,"02001":1,"02009":2,"02022":3,"02082":2,"04009":2,"04043":2,"04061":2,"04063":3}},{"id":1559,"name":"Whizzing through the Keyhole","creation":"2014-01-19 05:42:41","description":"<p>This is a deck inspired by the recent \"Through the Keyhole\" builds by HepatitvusJ and the discussion on them.

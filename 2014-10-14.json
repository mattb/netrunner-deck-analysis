[{"id":9722,"name":"Natural Selection","creation":"2014-10-14 01:30:45","description":"<p>The goal of the deck is to threaten the corporation with a very diverse set of breakers. The infamous <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01008\">Datasucker<\/a>-<a href=\"\/en\/card\/01012\">Parasite<\/a> combo deals with low strength ice like Komainu. \nClone Chip enables this combo to be used mid run as Quetzal's green hair fails to hide her inner wish to become a Shaper. <\/p>\n\n<p>Why <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01040\">The Personal Touch<\/a>? To enable <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01014\">Yog.0<\/a> to bypass Lotus Field, Viper and to slip out of the otherwise deadly Chum-Kitsune-combo.<\/p>\n\n<p>Does this deck have any weaknesses? The most apparent one would be Toolbooth, which really is a weakness to every runner deck. To combat Toolboth, I suggest using <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04043\">Knight<\/a> (Which was added just so you would be able to deal with that nasty piece of economical concrete), Datasucker+Parasite or just pray and run somewhere else. <\/p>\n\n<p>Another weakness (Which all Anarchs share) is card draw. Wyldside helps you out somewhat, but I usually never experience a problem with this. <\/p>\n\n<p>Here follows a quick ruthrough of how I use this deck to deal with the different corp-decks in my playgroup:<\/p>\n\n<p>NBN:FA: Natural Selection fares pretty well here, thanks to Quetzals build in answer to wraparound. They need to take more care early game and will have to work harder to get that Astro-engine running. Medium is wonderful against FA, as their uninteractive playstyle makes for some easy R&amp;D-running. Remember, a NBN-player who has to spend a turn Virus Purging is a sad NBN-player.<\/p>\n\n<p>Weyland-Glacier: Laugh at their Hadrian's Walls and Ice Walls. Cry when they ress Toolbooth. Don't be afraid of early runs. Especially on R&amp;D. Watch out for the Crisium Grid+Off The Grid-combo. Usually one of the easier matchups. <\/p>\n\n<p>Weyland Tag 'n Bag: <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02009\">Plascrete Carapace<\/a>. Run early and often. Get an Imp out to thrash any Scorched you come across. Usually works out in your favour. <\/p>\n\n<p>NBN Tagstorm: As NBN does not have very heavy ICE (Except for Toolboth). Wraparound won't save them. Same as with Weyland Tag 'n Bag. Try to get the <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02009\">Plascrete Carapace<\/a> and run early. <\/p>\n\n<p>HB Glacier: Usually a little tricker than the Weyland version. Their deck is very economy-reliant. Use Imp to thrash their sex-bots. \nDon't be afraid to make bad runs to make the corp ress ICE. <\/p>\n\n<p>Jinteki PE: Mimic, Parasite+Datasucker. Mimic works wonders against PE. Together with a <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01040\">The Personal Touch<\/a>+<a href=\"\/en\/card\/01014\">Yog.0<\/a> you will only have to worry about access-traps. Remember to never run last-click and to always have at least 3 cards in your hand when you run. Remember House of Knives and avoid using multi-access and you'll be fine. One more thing to note is to have credits ready to pay for Fetal AI and NAPD. <\/p>\n\n<p>Jinteki RP: Natural Selection usually works great against RP, as <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01014\">Yog.0<\/a> as well as <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01008\">Datasucker<\/a>+<a href=\"\/en\/card\/01012\">Parasite<\/a> disables many of their tricks. Thrash, maim, burn and leave your business card.<\/p>\n","username":"Fnassel","cards":{"01005":3,"01006":2,"01007":1,"01008":3,"01010":2,"01011":1,"01012":2,"01014":1,"01016":3,"01040":2,"01049":2,"01050":3,"02003":2,"02009":2,"02024":3,"02066":1,"02091":3,"02102":2,"03038":2,"03052":3,"04043":2,"06052":1}},{"id":9723,"name":"Near-Earth Hub (10\/10\/14)","creation":"2014-10-14 02:24:03","description":"\n","username":"Paranoid31","cards":{"01059":2,"01064":2,"01081":3,"01082":2,"01090":2,"01092":3,"01109":3,"01110":3,"02055":3,"02056":3,"02110":3,"02115":3,"04015":3,"04076":3,"04096":2,"04119":3,"04120":2,"05027":2,"06005":1,"06061":2}},{"id":9724,"name":"SlySquid's Pawnshop v3.3","creation":"2014-10-14 02:27:01","description":"<p>So I've been getting a lot more games in with this deck and have made a few more tweaks to make it more consistent, first being I'm only using <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01051\">Crypsis<\/a> as my main breaker, it's the every-breaker and will do most of the heavy lifting.\nNext was switching out <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01053\">Armitage Codebusting<\/a> for <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02022\">Liberated Account<\/a> this will net me one less credit but it also needs half the click investment, and if I'm running <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01051\">Crypsis<\/a> and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01016\">Wyldside<\/a> I need all the clicks I can get...\nLastly I dropped the <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01009\">Djinn<\/a>'s for more copy's of the cards I was planning on tutoring, the card works on paper but than again, so does communism.

(Mill deck)\nI really enjoyed playing a game with surprise to crush my opponent. \nI usually hate to win through a normal way, not just in ANR, but also in other BGs.There are already a huge amounts of flatlining deck already, however, flatlining someone is not the deck I am looking for.Flatlining someone is really fun, but in a trapping way. I like to control my rival instead of playing mind game.<\/p>\n\n<p>So I invented this deck=> andromeda: mill till you went crazy. <\/p>\n\n<p>The major concept is quite simple.\n0. Saving money by KT\n1. Set your rig with fall guys ,DLRs ,same old things and joshuaB (optional)\n2. Having enough breakers ( normally ZU, corroder and alias)\n3. Play your account siphon and recur it , making your opponent bankrupt. <\/p>\n\n<p>=====> Mill<\/p>\n\n<p>If corp has 0c ,it takes a whole turn to discard one resource! So if you have 3 (fall guys+DLRs) you can mill at least 3 turn = 15 cards (if Joshua is available)\n15 cards+ 5 starting hand+ 15mandatory draw+ 10 manual draw(on average)=45\nThe corp will have less than 10 cards left, it is almost decking!(include Jackson Howard usage)<\/p>\n\n<p>However,It's clear that its strategies need many cards to deal with.\nSo special order and hostage are all for tutoring the right card. \nKeyhole is more like a misleading that force the corp to Rez the ice in front of R&amp;D\nThe source + fall Guy is incredibly cool! Don't hesitate to use your fall guy to protect your the source!LOGOs is incredible too. You can tutor your fall guy and account siphon for free!\nCard explanation:<\/p>\n\n<h1>account siphon<\/h1>\n\n<p>to make the corp go bankrupt, there is no need to actually soak up his money!(If he already used up his money to Rez the ices, that's fine.<\/p>\n\n<h1>calling in favors<\/h1>\n\n<p>A strong midgame Econ with more than 6 or 7 connections. <\/p>\n\n<h1>dirty laundry<\/h1>\n\n<p>Also, use it to force the corp to Rez the ice that you \"cannot\" actually pass! Be aware of the sentry ice first! The core concept in this deck is to make the corp extremely poor. <\/p>\n\n<h1>hostage<\/h1>\n\n<p>In the very beginning, if your opponent is playing fast advance, pull the source first! If not , pull kati jones to accumulate your Econ <\/p>\n\n<h1>special order<\/h1>\n\n<p>Just a useful tutor. <\/p>\n\n<h1>sure gamble<\/h1>\n\n<p>Omitted. <\/p>\n\n<h1>logos<\/h1>\n\n<p>Very stressful console. If have the source and logos at the same time, that is way more than stress. In the early game you can pull out breakers or MR li to accomplish your combos. <\/p>\n\n<h1>plascrete carapace<\/h1>\n\n<p>Omitted. <\/p>\n\n<h1>data dealer<\/h1>\n\n<p>Trust me, this is extremely strong, In a non-scoring deck.\nIn my experience, the corp will score at least 5AP before I Finish my work. \nBut you may also try to threat the corp to make sure that he is not going to win. \nIn the process, you may get some extra agenda that is totally useless. So data dealer can be a great late game burn. <\/p>\n\n<h1>data leak reversal<\/h1>\n\n<p>Omitted. <\/p>\n\n<h1>fall guy<\/h1>\n\n<p>Use it to protect DLR or the source. <\/p>\n\n<h1>john masanori<\/h1>\n\n<p>To get cards during late game agenda checking in archives, or account siphoning. <\/p>\n\n<h1>joshuaB<\/h1>\n\n<p>Mill 5 cards in a turn!!!<\/p>\n\n<h1>kati jones<\/h1>\n\n<p>Useful Econ. <\/p>\n\n<h1>mr li<\/h1>\n\n<p>Useful drawing for combo pieces. <\/p>\n\n<h1>faerie<\/h1>\n\n<p>We need to show our respect to the corp that we will still attack your remote. \nWith alias only on the rig will make the corp to make careless decision\uff08with archer on scoring server and start to advance agendas\uff09<\/p>\n\n<h1>keyhole<\/h1>\n\n<p>scaring the corp with keyhole is extremely fun!!\nAgainst:<\/p>\n\n<h1>CI<\/h1>\n\n<p>simply sipohn the HQ in later game\u3002easy to win since he will draw extremely a lot!<\/p>\n\n<h1>PE<\/h1>\n\n<p>Little ice protected. And siphon will be quite easy to deal with. \nHouse of knife strategy is great for Logos because you can take extra combo cards. <\/p>\n\n<h1>weyland<\/h1>\n\n<p>Beware of posted bounty! Other cards won't be problem!\nHave plascrete in early game is crucial. <\/p>\n\n<h1>NEH<\/h1>\n\n<p>make sure you have hostage in your starting hand, pull your the source!\nOr fast advance leads to your lose. <\/p>\n\n<h1>MN<\/h1>\n\n<p>siphon approach.\nDon't be afraid of midseason since you seldom steal agendas. <\/p>\n\n<h1>ETF<\/h1>\n\n<p>make sure you tear down the melange ASAP<br \/>\nOr this ID will be too rich to siphon. <\/p>\n\n<h1>RP<\/h1>\n\n<p>Sundew is a nightmare!

There were 24 entrants with 5 rounds of Swiss and no cut. It went 4\/5 on the day, where its only loss was to a Noise, and I made a mistake on turn 1 by intending to play a hedge fund and pulling out scorch by accident. :P<\/p>\n\n<p>This deck is an extension of some 3-popup decks that I've made in the past and have had surprising results, including a 5th place at a Plugged In tournament. NEH makes this deck a lot better by emphasizing its strengths (now you draw lots of cards while making all of these remotes), shoring up some weaknesses (extra influence to spend on snares to help with huge central assaults), and just making room for a few more useful cards. I've broken from the balls to the wall 3 popup tradition and added a bit more ice; just enough to make it taxing for the runner while not putting too much of a dent in NBN's coffers.<\/p>\n\n<p>The plan is still the same. Overwhelm the runner with remotes. If they go for the remotes midseason them when they steal an agenda. If they don't get the train rolling. You also have the advantage of initially looking like the dominant archetype in the current meta, and runners might get a little bit too aggressive and get burned as a result.<\/p>\n\n<p>The deck can be surprisingly versatile; out of the four wins I had, one was a 7-point psychobeale, one was an astrotrain into breaking news, one was a triple scorch through plascrete, and one was a poor guy who hit a snare with two cards.<\/p>\n\n<p>The deck's biggest weaknesses are probably anarch in general (Noise, Whizzard to a lesser degree, Imp, Keyhole), and potentially repeated siphon spam, but it's not a losing battle; you just have to get a bit luckier in those matchups. There's a lot of targets anarchs have to trash to completely ruin you; if they hit a scorch, you can still fast advance, and if they get agendas, they might not have enough money to deal with the punishment that might follow.<\/p>\n","username":"talking_chicken","cards":{"01070":2,"01081":3,"01082":3,"01084":2,"01085":3,"01088":2,"01092":3,"01099":3,"01109":3,"01110":3,"02055":2,"02056":3,"02110":1,"02115":3,"02116":3,"04015":3,"04075":3,"04076":3,"04119":1,"06005":1}},{"id":9735,"name":"Junk Yard Dogs","creation":"2014-10-14 09:13:27","description":"<p>I wanted to bounce the Cerberus, only used two, and built from there<\/p>\n","username":"crash\/and\/burn","cards":{"01014":1,"01034":1,"01037":2,"01040":2,"01042":1,"01044":3,"01046":1,"02024":1,"02047":3,"02048":2,"02087":2,"02101":2,"02107":1,"03030":1,"03033":2,"03034":3,"03035":1,"03038":2,"03046":3,"03054":3,"04066":1,"05045":1,"06019":3,"06094":2,"06099":2}},{"id":9736,"name":"Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory","creation":"2014-10-14 10:49:45","description":"<p>This was a deck that I threw together for laughs that ended up working reasonably well.<\/p>\n\n<p>At its core, it's a reasonably standard stealth deck.

I have been testing it for about a week, and it is undefeated in-person and 14-2 online. Some of that is due to people not being familiar in how to play against it, but I also believe this is going to become one of the strongest identities when Weyland gets even more tricks in the near future.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Playstyle<\/h2>\n\n<p>This deck is all about keeping yourself pretty rich. It has the typical <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01086\">SEA Source<\/a> \/ <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01099\">Scorched Earth<\/a> combo, as well as some pretty big ice that you can rez over time because you never \"lose\" money in this deck. You always have your cred pool + whatever your highest rez-cost ice is for your trace, so flatline has been the primary win condition so far.<\/p>\n\n<p>This deck is all about hitting scoring windows. You want to get one over-advanced <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02018\">Project Atlas<\/a> as soon as you can to threaten flatline as well as stop Indexings and assure that you always have some econ. <\/p>\n\n<h2>Agendas<\/h2>\n\n<p>Somewhat familiar agenda spread here. <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02018\">Project Atlas<\/a> can find you the game winning <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01094\">Hostile Takeover<\/a> often. <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01106\">Priority Requisition<\/a> gives you free money. I'm still playing around with having both the fragments. <a href=\"\/en\/card\/06030\">Eden Fragment<\/a> stays for sure, as you will be installing ice a lot in this deck. <a href=\"\/en\/card\/06071\">Hades Fragment<\/a> is more of an anti-Noise \/ Power Shutdown combo agenda that may or may not be replaced.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Econ<\/h2>\n\n<p>These are pretty straightforward. Unless you're getting hit by some serious Account Siphon pressure, you're never that far from <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04040\">Restructure<\/a>. One of your best moves early for econ is to create a new server with <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04078\">Curtain Wall<\/a> and use <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02079\">Oversight AI<\/a>. It will take the runner 11 credits to break it if they want to stop you, but if they do not next turn it will net you 13 credits for a total of two clicks (three if you want to install it again). <a href=\"\/en\/card\/06008\">The Root<\/a> is Weyland's Sundew in this deck, protect it moderately well early on and then when it is done serving its purpose bounce it back for some more cash.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Ice<\/h2>\n\n<p>I wanted a good spread of cheap, early game ice and late-game glacier ice. The best ice you can have in your starting hand is <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02019\">Caduceus<\/a>. If you get the first trace off, Caduceus is free to rez, then you can bounce it back later essentially turning into a better <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01098\">Beanstalk Royalties<\/a>. <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01090\">Tollbooth<\/a> is a monster because you zap the runner for 3, then pull it back into your hand and put it somewhere else to do the same. You have <a href=\"\/en\/card\/06009\">Taurus<\/a> for Plascrete \/ other hardware destruction, and my personal favorite splash - <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02117\">Flare<\/a>. <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04117\">Hive<\/a> is another piece of strong early-game ice that you can just bounce back for a free Restructure once you have scored some points.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Odds and Ends<\/h2>\n\n<p>I've included <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04037\">Elizabeth Mills<\/a> for some more anti-Nosie\/Personal Workshop shenanigans as well as bad publicity removal.  Power Shutdown is a great card to help create scoring windows, but I am considering changing it out. Also watch out for Emergency Shutdown. That card can hurt you. Bad.<\/p>\n","username":"PackBenPack","cards":{"01086":2,"01090":2,"01094":3,"01099":3,"01102":1,"01106":1,"01110":3,"01111":2,"02018":3,"02019":3,"02079":3,"02110":2,"02117":1,"02120":1,"04015":2,"04037":2,"04040":3,"04058":2,"04078":2,"04117":2,"06008":2,"06009":2,"06030":1,"06068":1,"06071":1}},{"id":9762,"name":"Toying around w\/ The Foundry","creation":"2014-10-14 17:04:14","description":"\n","username":"mayhemnc2","cards":{"01055":3,"01056":3,"01064":3,"01105":3,"01106":3,"01110":3,"02051":1,"02070":3,"02092":3,"04011":3,"04015":2,"06002":3,"06010":1,"06011":3,"06021":1,"06030":1,"06032":3,"06051":3,"06061":2,"06091":3}},{"id":9763,"name":"Strongerest Together","creation":"2014-10-14 17:25:46","description":"<p>Lure the runner into delaying their breakers with clickable ICE until you're ready, then lock them out with Tollbooths and additional bioroids and start churning out agendas.

If you can get 2 hits of the same SanSan, especially to score at least 1 Astroscript, you are well on your way to win.

Scoring the first APP is probably the hardest thing, since you either need to put it down in a remote, or rez a SanSan which is costly. Make sure you stabilized your centrals first. If you score it too early and you're not stabilized, you will run out of gas before the game is over. If you try to score too late, the runner might be already set up and you won't be able to get it started.

Overmind can break the ice in the middle positions until paintbrush is out, which then paints it to either sentry or code gate, depending on which other breaker you find (Garrote or Gordian blade), with a preference towards gordian blade, explained in the next block.  Omega benefits from finding the MU cards early, so if you draw your deck backwards from how you want, you still benefit, they're not dead cards early basically.<\/p>\n\n<p>If you can paint down a server with code gate, blade maintains its strength, potentially saving you lots of cash over using omega.  I think gordian is the best breaker to have so long as you can account for a destroyer that isn't on the ends.  With test run as your fail safe, its not such a big deal to have it trashed.<\/p>\n\n<p>Scavenge works with test run to cheat out your big boys, and if you install garrote using the test run scavenge trick early, you can scavenge away garrote to install alpha or omega at 0 further investment.

SoT plays well with the missing bits and pieces of the test run -> scavenge combo, as well as Maker's eye.  Early siphons can be the key to winning, so you're looking for overmind or a cheap omega to get you in early and keep hammering.<\/p>\n\n<p>To play this, draw super heavy, mod out the big items, hopefully starting with omega and working to alpha, as well as getting mopus out asap.  Test run and scavenge the added bits.  Garrote is probably better vs Jinteki, where gordian blade is best against the rest, both when paintbrush is out.

Sansan is fun in that it's great to be able to use it, but I don't NEED it per say so I'm also happy to see the runner trash it for 5. I've only tested it against my regular opponent and his Kate deck, so I would be interested in hearing comments by more experienced players.\nAs the ice is more taxing than stopping, Account Siphon is a problem: thought of adding some closed accounts, but I don't know what to switch for it.<\/p>\n","username":"sakharov1","cards":{"01054":1,"01055":3,"01056":3,"01057":1,"01058":1,"01059":3,"01061":1,"01062":3,"01064":1,"01092":2,"01110":3,"02013":3,"02051":3,"02060":2,"02080":1,"02092":2,"02110":3,"03019":2,"03023":1,"03026":1,"04015":3,"04077":2,"04117":1,"04119":3,"04120":1}},{"id":4018,"name":"Kit Monolith v0.1","creation":"2014-04-08 23:29:00","description":"\n","username":"Stimutacs","cards":{"01018":2,"01027":1,"01034":3,"01035":2,"01037":3,"01043":3,"01044":3,"01050":3,"02009":2,"02027":1,"02066":1,"02087":3,"02107":2,"03028":1,"03033":3,"03035":3,"03036":2,"03044":2,"03046":2,"04088":1,"04108":3}}]

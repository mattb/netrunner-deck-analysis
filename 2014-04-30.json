Dirty Laundry is also the perfect combination for Paintbrush, so you can gain money on the run.\nBumped up Modded count to 3 since I have more than enough targets for it. Plus, if I'm going to drop Toolbox, I'd really prefer to pay 5 for it over 8.\nI noticed this deck often had weakness against decks with a lot of expensive resources and upgrades. I opened up influence with the removal of the Lucky Finds and got one Imp in. The idea here is if I see a match up where I need to destroy these cards, I can Test Run Imp, trash one, and then have Imp again for next turn the next time something drops to the table. I also got a Femme Fatale in to deal with things like Data Raven and Tollbooth.

Another possibility I'm playing with are Pri Req instead of Gov Contracts, but the deck really needs 2 things - Money and Meat damage so the current agendas help with that.<\/p>\n\n<p>Off the Grids are meant to be used to lock out 3 remotes, 2 for Dedicated Response Teams and 1 for scoring in. This leaves the runner 3 servers to run on and one that we certainly don't want them running. Due to what I said above they have generally a low chance of hitting Agendas so using R&amp;D as the cheese for the trap. I've tried to have a mix of both Tax\/Tag Ice for that reason and EtR hard Ice for HQ (and archives where sneakdoor is installed). The idea is 2 ICE towers, where HQ they can't really get through and then R&amp;D is much more appealing but both topped with Ireress to strip them of the BP (at least until Yog hits the table - but you want to keep a killer unrezzed then). <\/p>\n\n<p>R&amp;D needs a Data Raven or a Bernice at least to give out tags as we don't really mind them being successful, and in fact want them to be sometime. DRT\/Cleaners can tax, hurt badly, or if played well in surprise can flatline. if they hit an agenda there's hopefully a Punitive Counterstrike in hand.\nHQ is to be blocked up as big as possible obviously and then generally leave Archives relatively open as the idea is unless they have Sneakdoor we can let them decide whether charging Datasucker is worth the meat damage.<\/p>\n\n<p>Of course there are problems: Yog mashes the Ireress and then servers will be free. I often feel I need 10+ credits and can't come back when I've been bankrupted, and as x3r0h0ur mentions below there needs to be a fair order to how you draw.

(BETA)","creation":"2014-04-30 09:41:58","description":"<p>Okay, so today I finally sat down and went through the Jinteki cards in the new expansion. Leaving alone the countless new decks that sprout in my mind, I decided to focus on improving an already solid deck. <strong>There are <em>two<\/em> major branches<\/strong> where I see the Replicating Kills deck going and today I'll share one of them, which is closer to the original deck. <\/p>\n\n<p>I'll actually get my hands on the expansion next Wed, so there is some <em>heavy<\/em> theory crafting involved here, but to be honest, all decks in the next 1 month or more will be the same, because we will definitely need a couple of months to feel out the new cards and where the Runner meta is shifting especially. Having said this though, I'm about 4\/5 sure that the changes I make here <em>will<\/em> play out as expected, because I'm <strong>really familiar<\/strong> with the original deck and its playstyle =) <\/p>\n\n<h2>General Mindset<\/h2>\n\n<h2>Agendas Spread<\/h2>\n\n<p>Changes:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>1x Philotic Entanglement -> for -> 1xFetal AI . This agenda is <strong>really<\/strong> strong in <strong>any<\/strong> kill deck and although I'm sure that it will see a lot more usage in PE, having 1 for 0 advance score and not to mention all the damage combos that it will sprout ( put 3 advances on it and score it at the start of your turn +3 more clicks for Neural, PS and friends). It's basically like what Braintrust could do in the old deck, <em>but<\/em> so much better  in <em>this<\/em> deck because of all the <strong>on score<\/strong> effects. <\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>3x The Future Perfect -> for -> 3x Priority Req. This is basically an auto-include, because it's a 3-pointer with an in-build Caprice effect. The only, and <em>only<\/em>, reason you would play Priority Req in <em>this<\/em> deck  is if the new ICE proves to be way too expensive.<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<h2>Speaking of ICE<\/h2>\n\n<p>Tatara... the cavalry has arrived !! <\/p>\n\n<h3>Komainu<\/h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>I love this card so much. Now they can forget about running without their codegate breaker as well! It also punishes blind Knight-ing, because enjoy that loss of 10 credits ;) <strong>The only<\/strong> problem for this card is Parasite and that's why I'm playing just 1 copy. Parasite just destroys Komainu. If the meta shifts out away from Parasite I'll jack up even 2 or 3 of it. <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<h3>Shiro<\/h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>What Yagura wants to be when it grows up? =) It's just a much stronger Yagura oriented towards mid and late game. Now I have a question about the 2nd subroutine of this ICE. Does it mean that he access the top card as in he can't jack out? Or as in he immediately access it, before next ICE (if there is such)?   Either way it will be good, but it might make me try to squeeze in 3x Snare! instead of the 3x Shocks! <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<h3>Susanoo-no-Mikoto<\/h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Now, here is the one change which I'm most uncertain about. On one side it's just a great piece of ICE to have on your remote. Soaks up 4 data sucker token for a mimic and 7 money on a ninja. Obviously, the 3xShocks in the deck are here for that ICE. <strong>Here is where it gets tricky<\/strong>. Obviously you would wan't to leave the Archives <em>open<\/em> so Susanoo's sub can send them in there for \"free 3 net damage\". However, a <strong>good<\/strong> player, will use the no-ICE archives to easily get rid off the Identity's ability and jack out without accessing. IF you put ICE on Archives, Susanoo will send them into it (which could be nice if it's an Ichi 1.0 or smt) and they won't get hit by Shocks!.  <strong>This<\/strong> particular synch <em>will<\/em> need testing.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<h3>Guard<\/h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>You want 3 of those, because Inside Job might be the only thing that they can pull out early game to access your remote and with the new Criminal IDs I bet we will see quite a lot of Inside Jobing ;) <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<h3>You have 9 free influence in this deck - Go NUTS on the crazy ICE!<\/h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The ones I threw in are just an example of what I feel would be good in this deck. The 2x Ichi 1.0 will do some work, the Tollbooth as always is perfect fit for this deck. Heimdal 2.0 is an <strong>overkill<\/strong> for this deck and it's probably the first card you should swap out if you feel poor, but it's just there to give you an idea how much free influence and crazy things u can put in ;) <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<h2>The other cards ...<\/h2>\n\n<h3>Mushin No Shin<\/h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>This card will do some solid work in this deck. First it takes a HUGE financial burden off you for advancing your agendas. <em>Second and more importantly<\/em> you can bait them so hard with <strong>Psychic Field<\/strong>. You just put it there and they are like \"oh 3 advances, can't be Snare! let's expose it to see if it's a 3 pointer or 2 pointer\" - GG sons ;) It has <em>infinite<\/em>  amount of uses in this deck and not to mention that putting the new 2\/3 agenda with it , <strong>fits perfectly for the combo of scoring it at the star of your next turn + the 3 clicks to do damage<\/strong>. <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<h3>Chairman Hiro<\/h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Every company should have a Chairman, right?! He is <em>IDEAL<\/em> for this deck and here are a few reasons why. One - it works like NAPD contract for 2 more credits! Two- makes killing the runner a piece of cake! Three - IT WORKS WITH PS !! Omg, sry for the caps, it's just that this card gives me a huge boner in this deck ;) <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<h3>Psychic Field + Diversified Portfolio+ Shocks<\/h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Well, the Diversified Portfolio comes in as a replacement for Subliminal. This will need some testing, <strong>but the general idea<\/strong> is that it will make use of laying down unprotected Private Contracts, Shocks and Psychic Fields (maybe even some Sundews), which you will be putting down anyway, to not clog your hand and have space for PS and Neural EMPs. If it doesn't prove to work as intended, swap out for 2x Celebrity Gift and enjoy.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Psychic Field. Except the obvious synergy with Mushin no Shin, which I talked about, it will pay off for Diversified Portfolio and the runner needs exactly <em>one<\/em> run into them, to stop checking your unadvanced, unprotected remote servers ;)<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Shocks! obviously for the synergy with Susasnoo's subroutine. What <em>I<\/em> would do (if no space in hand) would be to throw one down, unprotected for Diversified Portfolio to earn me money! If I draw into another one, install over the first sending the first one in the Archives ready for Susanoo's!  <em>IF<\/em> testing proves that the synergy doesn't worth it, swap 3x Shock! for 3xSnare! with same usage, but <strong>Snare!<\/strong> synergy with <strong>Shiro<\/strong>!<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>I think that pretty much covers it ;) I'll be editing and formatting for a while, please BEAR with me for 1-2 days until I get the text in its final form.

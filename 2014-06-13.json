I favor R&amp;D.<\/p>\n\n<p>Tenma Line goes in an unprotected remote.<\/p>\n\n<p>Early game, AIZ enables those Komainu or Tsurugi to cost 2c or 3c, respectively, in line with your now 0-1c Wall of Static\/Bastion suite. Your 1c Quandries and Pups pull triple duty between early protection against runs, Parasite bait to spare a Komainu or Tsurugi, or as unrezzed mystery dick-cards to screw with Kit decks or just force people to pull out a Code Gate just for Quandries.<\/p>\n\n<p>All the ICE is still cheap enough that without the AIZ draw, you can still afford to rez them; they're all taxing, so even if they aren't in optimal order, you won't be letting the runner through cheap, and 2-deep on all centrals is a good place to be anyway so that you can mix and match with Tenma.<\/p>\n\n<p>Some of your ICE will still be unrezzed since the core combo of install on remote unrezzed > install on AIZ > third click to swap the two pieces will leave some unrezzed. As a result, Escher hurts much less than you'd think; you know the board state at any given time, the runner doesn't, and only you can fully alter it.<\/p>\n\n<p>There are 10 agendas, all 2-pointers. Philotic is a perfect 1-off for this. Fetals pair with your net damage to make early game baited traps. Fetals flatline early game when behind a Komainu. Waiting to drop in the Fetal until you either have the 2 desired ICE in hand, or at least installing the ICE first then install-advance-advance the next turn, is pretty taxing on the runner early. Transforming a blown-up Sundew remote into a Komainu-Fetal bomb subtly via Tenma Line is a wonderful thing.<\/p>\n\n<p>Assets get used as feints, but like everything else in this deck get used as the situation calls for. PAD Campaigns generally go down unprotected to draw the tempo hit. Sundews get installed only when they can be protected; they are by no means required, but they supercharge this deck by giving you a free 2\/4\/6c every turn. Good runners WILL prioritize blowing them up, so make it expensive so that the runner has to decide between unprotected rezzed PAD Campaigns, protected Sundews, unprotected unrezzed AIZs as standalone remotes (which may be traps to the runner's eye) with SanSan cities both as a unprotected standalone and a 2+ deep iceberg.<\/p>\n\n<p>Medical Breakthroughs are used to bait\/force the runner to panic. You almost WANT the runner to have Medical Breakthroughs. Once one of them is scored\/stolen, you can score the remaining 2 out of hand off a SanSan grid or you can leave it in your standalone remote farm for a turn before you score it, maybe while deploying a protected Sundew as well.<\/p>\n","username":"Manjusri","cards":{"01064":3,"01092":2,"01109":3,"01110":3,"01113":3,"02014":3,"02031":1,"02032":3,"02038":3,"03026":3,"04015":3,"04054":3,"04074":3,"04120":3,"05005":3,"05006":1,"05012":2,"05017":3,"05018":2}},{"id":6704,"name":"CoolBox Kate","creation":"2014-06-13 02:22:35","description":"<p>and odd deck i am trying out. any suggestion small tricks would be great, possibly building this up for local tournaments, and i just wanted to try something new (i usually play Criminal)<\/p>\n","username":"Vithar","cards":{"01007":1,"01008":2,"01012":2,"01014":1,"01030":1,"01033":1,"01034":3,"01036":3,"01038":2,"01043":2,"01044":1,"01050":3,"01053":1,"02091":2,"03038":3,"03040":2,"03041":2,"03042":1,"03046":3,"03049":1,"03052":2,"03054":3,"04029":2,"05035":2}},{"id":6705,"name":"Kate Event Toolbox","creation":"2014-06-13 03:05:12","description":"<p>Get into any servers fast<\/p>\n","username":"shazzner","cards":{"01008":1,"01018":2,"01026":2,"01033":1,"01034":3,"01035":3,"01036":1,"01044":1,"01050":3,"02047":3,"02066":1,"02087":2,"02106":1,"02107":2,"03031":1,"03034":3,"03035":1,"03038":2,"03040":2,"03046":2,"03048":1,"03054":3,"04029":3,"05036":2}},{"id":6706,"name":"Jinteki Modernism v1.0","creation":"2014-06-13 03:42:24","description":"<p>This deck is my attempt at a Jinteki interpretation of the <a href=\"http:\/\/netrunnerdb.com\/en\/decklist\/2512\/supermodernism\">Supermodernism<\/a> archetype.<\/p>\n\n<p>The general principle remains the same.  Bully the runner into running slowly through a credible flatline threat.  Exploit a slow runner by advancing agendas out, exploit a reckless runner through a flatline.  However, there are two main advantages I find in the Jinteki variation.<\/p>\n\n<p>1)  ICE can threaten a flatline.  Supermodernism ice typically is not very threatening outside of archer.  The Jinteki ice is generally a lot more damaging and distruptive.  A Chum+Komainu can end a careless runner.  Though this rarely happens in practice the net effect is that unrezed ice is very threatening.  Even after getting a sentry breaker, Inazuma keeps the threat alive until the runner has a full breaker suite.<\/p>\n\n<p>2)  All agendas are self defending.  One of the weaknesses of Supermodernism is leaking early points out of R&amp;D through a series of lucky\/unlucky accesses.  While it is still possible for the Jinteki version to leak points, every agenda stolen is taxing to the runner and serves as a deterrent to further runs.  Multi-access (which is quite popular in today's meta with Legwork and Maker's Eye) is also quite dangerous against this deck and can easily lead to a flatline.<\/p>\n\n<p>Some notable synergies present:<\/p>\n\n<p>ID + Punitive Counterstrike + Neural EMP can turn a stolen agenda (especially a Fetal AI) into a flatline with very little credits.<\/p>\n\n<p>Chump + Pup is excellent defense for very little money.<\/p>\n\n<p>Komainu is a rockstar in this deck.

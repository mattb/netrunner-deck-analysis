It runs extremely economically and it needs to! The key strategy is to draw heavy and establish R&amp;D lock early creating a race to win situation. <\/p>\n\n<p>The first 4-5 turns are important you need to draw at least once every turn and play a piece of Hardware or Program maximising Kate\u2019s ability. Pro-Co is gold and don\u2019t hesitate to first turn play it then use it to draw then play a 1-cost hardware for free then an SMC (my favourite opening).<\/p>\n\n<p>It doesn\u2019t hurt to check the first few pieces of ICE against FA decks which are the hardest matchup to force them to rez but don\u2019t waste your resources on trashing unless it can\u2019t be avoided. You need breakers super quick so draw more than usual to keep up.<\/p>\n\n<p>Once you have an SMC out you can grab the appropriate breaker and this deck will reach a point where you can run for \u2018free\u2019 once every turn maybe twice. I often use Clone Chip on SMC to get the next breaker as needed.<\/p>\n\n<p>Modded I usually save to play the R&amp;D interfaces and only burn it to get out Dagger\/Shiv\/Plascrete when it seems necessary. <\/p>\n\n<p>Drawbacks are lack of multi access on HQ. Making one solid run each turn which is usually R&amp;D becomes much better with multi access. Then once you have established decent lock start sniping HQ or the remotes. Try and flush some agendas out.<\/p>\n\n<p>Changes:\n\u2022   Against PE\/RP decks I have been using Feedback Filter instead of the 3rd Lockpick with some success. Sometimes just preventing 1 net damage will keep you alive and of course being able to check traps and prevent brain Damage is a great backup ability.\n\u2022   I have considered trading Special Order for Parasite or HQ Interface it deserves further testing.\n\u2022   Using Shiv instead of Dagger is a personal choice they both have benefits and drawbacks.\n\u2022   Corroder seems better in most cases over Blackcat so far in testing although Corroder uses more \u2018real\u2019 money for larger barriers.<\/p>\n\n<p>The fiscal nature of this style requires practice and being aware which pieces need to come out first. That may not appeal to all players but I\u2019d love to hear back any feedback or modifications?<\/p>\n","username":"Ebonheart01","cards":{"01007":1,"01022":1,"01033":1,"01034":3,"01035":3,"01038":3,"01050":3,"02009":1,"02107":3,"03038":3,"03041":3,"03046":3,"03049":3,"03053":3,"04006":3,"04104":3,"06040":3,"06057":1,"06077":1,"06079":1}},{"id":9782,"name":"Planned Chaos 1.1","creation":"2014-10-15 03:20:48","description":"\n","username":"kedromelon","cards":{"01007":1,"01018":1,"01026":1,"01034":3,"01036":2,"01043":1,"01044":1,"01050":3,"02009":2,"02046":1,"02047":3,"02106":3,"03034":3,"03035":1,"03038":2,"03046":2,"03049":2,"03053":2,"03054":3,"05035":2,"05036":2}},{"id":9784,"name":"The Heinlein Manoeuvre","creation":"2014-10-15 04:46:09","description":"<p>Firstly let me say this is not a tournament deck this is a league night deck as it requires several extra turns to win. I made it to obtain the achievement of winning with 30 credits in the bank which it did effortlessly. This is a as you can see a glacier deck capable of scoring out 3 point agendas in relative safety and has a very good win rate with added bonus of fun to play.<\/p>\n\n<p>The initial setup will naturally depend on your opening hand but the classic opening start is Victor 1.0 (or Viper) and a Heinlein Grid on R&amp;D or HQ. Once the runner initiates the run rez HG in the appropriate window and watch the runner decide whether to take a brain damage or lose all their money. Once the runner begins playing breakers then Ichi is another ICE that works well with HG.<\/p>\n\n<p>Surviving the first few turns which is the weakest stage of this deck is crucial and most likely where you will lose the game due to those big fat 3 point agendas up for grabs. After that you should be ok. I have been 5 agenda points\u2019 down but once I hit mid game was able to lock the runner out and easily win. <\/p>\n\n<p>The early to mid-game involves cards like Encryption Login Protocol and The Root. Always protect The Root it is gold in this deck. I use it to rez Adonis and Eves to offset the initial loss, to place ICE 2-3 deep and still make a credit off my ID, not to mention advancing agendas and rezzing. Once The Root is safely up my cash usually leaps forward 10-20 credits very quickly. Archived Memories is nearly always used to bring it back or if they ignore it then ELP or ASH is next best choice (same for Jackson).<\/p>\n\n<p>It is then a process of setting up your scoring server which I usually begin over an Adonis. As the Adonis ticks down I begin placing Tollbooth, Ash, Heimdal etc.<\/p>\n\n<p>Changes: \n\u2022   I would consider changing Neural Katana I usually place it on Archives in case of Security Testing but it could easily be any other 2 INF ICE for a surprise. \n\u2022   I would love another ASH and the one card I have considered trying to squeeze in as it can be a game breaker. <\/p>\n\n<p>If anyone plays this let me know I would love feedback and thoughts on any way to improve further?<\/p>\n","username":"Ebonheart01","cards":{"01054":1,"01055":1,"01056":3,"01058":1,"01061":2,"01062":2,"01063":3,"01077":1,"01090":1,"01106":1,"01110":3,"02013":1,"02052":3,"02070":2,"02092":3,"02110":3,"03006":2,"03015":1,"03019":1,"04015":3,"04077":1,"04119":3,"06008":2,"06022":2,"06023":3,"06071":1}},{"id":9785,"name":"Stronger money","creation":"2014-10-15 05:01:22","description":"<p>I wanted to make stronger together and wanted to make it work so dumped tonnes of money into deck<\/p>\n","username":"jollyskulls","cards":{"01055":2,"01056":2,"01061":2,"01062":2,"01063":2,"01108":3,"01110":3,"02010":1,"02012":1,"02051":3,"02070":3,"02080":3,"02110":3,"03006":2,"03007":1,"03014":2,"03017":2,"03019":2,"04030":2,"04076":2,"04114":2,"06003":2,"06023":3}},{"id":9786,"name":"A Colourful Whale","creation":"2014-10-15 07:30:29","description":"\n","username":"Pegaz","cards":{"01002":3,"01006":3,"01008":3,"01012":3,"01038":2,"01044":3,"01050":3,"02021":3,"02024":3,"02050":3,"02102":3,"04043":3,"04061":3,"06033":3,"06052":1,"06054":3,"06059":1}},{"id":9787,"name":"Kate and Friends","creation":"2014-10-15 07:36:41","description":"<p>Just putting this out there for public comment.<\/p>\n","username":"verge","cards":{"01007":1,"01033":1,"01040":3,"01044":2,"01045":1,"01047":2,"02066":2,"02068":2,"02085":1,"02088":2,"02107":2,"03038":3,"03039":2,"03041":3,"03042":2,"03046":3,"03047":2,"03053":3,"04004":1,"04006":2,"05055":2,"06019":2,"06056":1,"06057":2,"06058":2,"06076":1}},{"id":9788,"name":"Chaotic Woman","creation":"2014-10-15 08:16:53","description":"<p>Just a new shaper deck I'm going to try out.

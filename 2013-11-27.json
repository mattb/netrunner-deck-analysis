I don't run Hostile Takeover so Archer is too painful imo. Hit the runner with a Rototurret buffed with Corp Troubleshooter instead. The runner will still think you have an archer if you score a geothermal\/or P'atlas. Just ICE up HQ and keep the runner out with CT. ICE up archives vs Sneakdoor Beta (one Hadrians wall is good). Every ICE is an EtR ICE. I needed JH to dig for agendas so I can score them while the runner is looking for a solution. Extra counters on P'atlas can dig for CT to keep runner out or agendas to score. Ideal score imo, P'atlas for 4, use counter to get second P'atlas, advance for 4, last counter for Government Contracts for the win. 3 5\/3 agendas can be dangerous but I'm going for risk\/reward here. Hopefully the runner will worry about tag n bag and slow himself down.","username":"HepatitvsJ","cards":{"01064":3,"01065":3,"01093":1,"01098":3,"01102":2,"01103":3,"01110":3,"01111":2,"01113":2,"02018":3,"02019":3,"02052":3,"02070":3,"02077":3,"03026":1,"04015":3,"04017":3,"04038":3,"04040":3}},{"id":673,"name":"Noise Milling Machine v1.0","creation":"2013-11-27 18:03:49","description":"","username":"khorne666","cards":{"01001":1,"01002":2,"01004":3,"01005":3,"01006":2,"01008":3,"01009":2,"01010":1,"01012":3,"01015":1,"01016":1,"01029":2,"01047":1,"01050":3,"02003":2,"02022":2,"02041":1,"02042":2,"02049":2,"02081":3,"02102":3,"02103":2,"02109":2,"03053":3}},{"id":674,"name":"Noise Milling Machine v1.0","creation":"2013-11-27 18:45:21","description":"","username":"khorne666","cards":{"01001":1,"01002":2,"01004":3,"01005":3,"01006":2,"01008":3,"01009":2,"01010":1,"01012":3,"01015":1,"01016":1,"01029":2,"01047":1,"01050":3,"02003":2,"02041":1,"02049":2,"02081":3,"02102":3,"02103":2,"02109":2,"03052":2,"03053":3,"04009":2}},{"id":675,"name":"NPE","creation":"2013-11-27 19:42:05","description":"Just playing around with identities I normally don't use.","username":"Gakochun","cards":{"01003":2,"01004":2,"01018":3,"01019":3,"01020":3,"01021":3,"01028":1,"01050":3,"01051":2,"02043":3,"02083":1,"02085":3,"02087":3,"02090":3,"02104":3,"03046":2,"03052":3,"04029":3}}]

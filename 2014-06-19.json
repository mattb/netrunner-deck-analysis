I explained in previous version some specific choices. It's a straightforward deck that uses Anarch tools to try and keep the Corp poor early. My net damage defense is redundancy.<\/p>\n\n<p>Biggest problem were taxing RP decks and a taxing NBN deck. I lost to Red Poncho twice, NBN Yellow Jackets once, NBN FA once, and GRNDL. The last two were definitely winnable...indeed, against GRNDL I actually had an 0-for-8 Medium dig at one point (but to be fair I was definitely outplayed, that guy got 5th I think). The taxing decks are a problem. I lost to the people who 1st, 2nd, 4th, and 5th place in the tournament...so I don't feel too bad about the losses.<\/p>\n\n<p>I could shift to Whizzard and go -3 Daily Casts, +3 Kati Jones. I could also go -1 on each breaker and +3 Daily Casts, since Quality Time got me breakers somewhat reliably. Noise does not work after testing, it causes early ice on Archives that prevents easy suckers, and the ability is not inherently taxing to the Corp.<\/p>\n\n<p>Win condition is obvious -- use the best breakers out there and the best dig card (Medium) and go to town. Redundancy lets you run with impunity. Money was the biggest issue, even with 12 econ cards (14 if you count Desperado). Kati would help a lot. I mean, I had plenty of money to beat certain decks (I beat NBN FA twice, HB:EtF and NEXT one), but the glacier decks in double elims were a problem.<\/p>\n","username":"grogboxer","cards":{"01002":3,"01007":3,"01008":3,"01009":2,"01010":2,"01011":3,"01012":3,"01014":3,"01024":2,"01050":3,"02009":2,"02041":1,"02087":3,"03052":3,"03053":3,"04041":1,"04043":3,"04109":3}},{"id":6926,"name":"Small Rigging","creation":"2014-06-19 04:07:33","description":"<p>Modified my Big Rigging deck, everything is now significantly cheaper and should be easier to keep momentum against the corp.

Djinn and Grimoire are the crux of the deck, and it is massively MU heavy hence the Akamatsu mem chips. Bishops, datasucker tokens, and parasites combined with ice carver destroy ice scarily faster. A rezzed archer with a parasite on it with one counter on it, can be destroyed with a bishop and merely two datasucker tokens so long as ice carver is out. Cheap at half the price! Ice carver is worth its weight in gold, as suddenly loads of ice becomes vulnerable to the fixed breaker suite. Morning star is expensive, but the deck can afford it with Kati, and then it pays for itself easily. New Angeles enables tag avoidance, and security testing makes archives safe to run vs Jinteki and a quick way of building money and virus counters.<\/p>\n\n<p>Chakana I haven't tested yet, but touch wood it is pretty obvious why it is in their, hopefully coming out early on top of a grimoire. It should force the corp to purge virus counters far more often, dictating tempo, bishop providing a temporary counter to a lack of virus counters. Knight is there for emergencies primarily. <\/p>\n\n<p>Any comments or advice are very much appreciated.  I am very uncertain about the numbers of specific cards, and could do with some help on that front.

I was worried about the 60-minute rounds, but didn't have too much time trouble this time around.<\/p>\n\n<p>Went 5\u20131 in Swiss; the loss was due to an awful mulligan. Went 3\u20130 in the late-night elimination rounds, i.e. I beat a bunch of folks who were half asleep.<\/p>\n\n<p>Out of the 8 games I won, 7 of them leaked 5 or 6 points along the way. Hooray for the new scoring format.<\/p>\n\n<p>So anyway, the changes since Portland were to remove a bunch of traps and focus on early ice. Paper Wall and Himitsu are good early ice and can also be used later to destroy your remote if you need to \u2014 you can often rush HoK and NAPD early. Midori helps you take the known price tags off a fully rezzed server and keep the guessing game alive, and can work well to bump hosted programs\/counters sometimes. I never used her to whip out an Inazuma over an Archer, but then I also never used RSVP to stick the runner with a FAI or NAPD they couldn't score. Oh well.<\/p>\n\n<p>The worst thing that can happen with this deck is if you get stuck permanently with bad pub. It happens every now and then. Then again, that can also lead to a Philotic kill that much more easily.<\/p>\n\n<p>I don't think the deck is necessarily top-tier \u2014 during practice games for Regionals, it didn't hold up well during repeated games against Andysucker with Security Testing \u2014 but it worked well as a mystery deck.

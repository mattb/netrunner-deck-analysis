At the first signs of trouble, it tags potential threats to the system with pinpoint accuracy, and prevents the loss of information through evasive countermeasures. The thief's movements on the net are recorded for later 'prosecution'by the corporate cleaners. If you are a person of interest, you're already dead -- you just don't know it yet.\" <\/p>\n\n<p>This deck looks similar to other NBN decks in that it runs <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01099\">Scorched Earth<\/a>, sure, but that's just the tip of the iceberg. The main point of this deck is to tag your opponent -- not once, but multiple times. The more they're tagged, the better. One of the deck's main win conditions is to use <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01085\">Psychographics<\/a>. So, for example, let's say the runner is tagged 5 times already (through sneaky use of <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01087\">Ghost Branch<\/a>and perhaps a <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01086\">SEA Source<\/a>). We already have a <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02115\">Project Beale<\/a>up to 3 advancement counters, and previously scored an <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01081\">AstroScript Pilot Program<\/a>(which still has its counter). We Psychographics for 5, putting them all on Beale and remove the Script counter for 9 advancement counters total and we score it for 5 agenda points. You just won the game. <\/p>\n\n<p>So, maybe the Runner decides to clear some tags during another game. He spends most of his turn clearing tags ($$$ down the drain for them). Maybe he has one tag left on him. <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02035\">Big Brother<\/a> is watching him the whole time and tags him again a few times for good measure. Maybe he steals an agenda this turn, too.<a href=\"\/en\/card\/02116\">Midseason Replacements<\/a> is there to provide some just retribution, and we use Psychographics on a Beale for 7 and immediately score 4 agenda points.

There's a bit of clicking for money in the early game, but if an Underworld Contact is running, then things get much easier. Top target for Hostage is Mr. Li because he can sift through the deck very quickly. John comes in later once the servers are soft enough over the course of the game. Rook'd ice gets trashed fairly frequently, opening up easy Pawn promotion plays to reintroduce pressure. I would rather not play The Helpful AI, but searchable Link is too good to pass up as a backup. Even with Overmind, I prefer Access to Globalsec over Dyson because of the cheaper install cost. Corroder is in there mainly for Himitsu-Bako; keeping Knights off Wraparounds is just a bonus. Mimic is there mainly for Swordsman. Tallie hoses most of the Weyland playstyle, but her alone doesn't stop a SEA Source, Double Scorched play against a corp that started its turn with zero bad publicity. Joshua B. doesn't mesh well with this playstyle. The corp has to earn their tags.<\/p>\n","username":"Wakks","cards":{"01002":1,"01007":1,"01011":1,"01012":3,"01052":3,"01053":2,"02003":2,"02008":1,"02024":1,"02063":1,"02069":3,"02091":1,"02105":1,"04002":3,"04003":3,"04004":2,"04009":1,"04021":2,"04041":1,"04042":3,"04043":3,"04083":1,"05031":2,"05053":3,"05055":1}},{"id":7304,"name":"Kit Yog","creation":"2014-07-02 13:37:05","description":"\n","username":"Gygrazok","cards":{"01014":3,"01021":2,"01026":1,"01034":3,"01037":3,"01040":2,"01043":2,"01044":2,"01046":1,"01050":3,"01053":1,"02008":2,"02009":1,"02027":1,"02047":3,"02048":2,"02066":2,"02091":2,"03028":1,"03034":3,"03044":3,"03052":2,"04088":1}},{"id":7305,"name":"A Link to Roja","creation":"2014-07-02 13:42:03","description":"<p>Trying to build a link based Roja deck not sure it will work any ideas welcome<\/p>\n","username":"Pinkwarrior","cards":{"01002":2,"01005":2,"01007":2,"01008":3,"01009":2,"01010":1,"01011":2,"01012":3,"01014":2,"01022":2,"01050":3,"02002":2,"02008":1,"02022":3,"02028":2,"02041":1,"02069":3,"02091":1,"02105":1,"02109":3,"04004":2,"04009":1,"04041":1,"04106":2,"05033":1}},{"id":7306,"name":"CT - Logos - Overmind (C.L.OVER)","creation":"2014-07-02 14:15:22","description":"<p>Playing around with the idea of including Logos in a Shaper deck.

It could likely be strengthened somewhat by including the Siphon recursion credit engine, but with a lot of anti-Siphon tech (and play styles) coming into the meta, it may be time to learn to play without them anyway ;-)<\/p>\n\n<h2>The Theme<\/h2>\n\n<p>A spy, a Femme Fatale, a Woman in a Red Dress, and a Bug. A shady Supplier, unregistered weapons, triad\/mafia contacts, and a Passport. Blackmail, Hostages and a Frame Job or two. This deck writes itself, and makes for a thrilling spy novel and maybe an alright build?<\/p>\n\n<h2>About the deck (composition and strategy)<\/h2>\n\n<p>The deck is a six AM design that has a little testing and I'm going to admit that it is hard to play. The key idea is that information is power and knowing what the Corp has in hand is crucial to being able to determine when to go with Iain for the win from behind. I think this is the critical  aspect to getting him right; mistime the \"come from behind\" attempt  and you lose before you go. Go too early and you whiff, lose your advantage and lose anyway.<\/p>\n\n<p>To that end, there's Woman in the Red Dress to see what's on top of R&amp;D and Bug to check out what they draw at other times, though using this assiduously is important to avoid draining all your Iain credits. Note that although WitRD is a critical piece, better resources to Hostage out early game are definitely Kati Jones (you have time with this deck to make use of her ability to the fullest) and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/06056\">The Supplier<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>The Supplier does excellent work in conjunction with Stirling's ability: Logos and HQIs are effectively free installs off it. Most of your Resources are free or only one credit, but it doesn't synergise with Hostage as you have to pay the install cost to drop the Resource in the same action as fetching it, so you may as well have it in play for real. That said, I think this card is so useful to the deck that it might be useful to go up to three copies, despite it being unique.<\/p>\n\n<p>The central only breakers are pretty efficient at getting you where you need to go, when you focus only on the central servers and simply ignore the remotes. The only time you want to make a remote run is when you're Blackmailing the Corp; don't let them rez any ice in the remote server at all, or the whole game plan unfolds. Frame Job away the first agenda that you steal to turn on Iain's ability again, and give the Corp the BP needed to get the Blackmail off.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"\/en\/card\/02079\">OAI<\/a>, <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02038\">AIZ<\/a>, <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01055\">ABT<\/a> and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01106\">PriReq<\/a> all wreck that game plan by potentially rezzing ice on the remote, which you simply cannot deal with. I think the solution to this is to either squeeze in a <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01051\">Crypsis<\/a>, or work in two or three <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02043\">Emergency Shutdown<\/a>s.

He has several; I forget which incarnation this is. For those unfamiliar, use Power Shutdown and Wisp to keep Fracters out of the rig.<\/p>\n\n<p>Project Atlas is your all-star Agenda. You ideally want to rush out an early one and over-advance it at least once. With Atlas counters you can fish out Takeovers for emergency money, or the last agenda point. You can also use it to dig a 5\/3 out of RND in a multi-access emergency. Most often, you will use it to snag Takeovers for the win.<\/p>\n\n<p>Archer and Roto are for surprise program destruction. Chimera can save you if they end up with a fracter at an inopportune moment. Remember, Shutdown and Wisp are dead cards once the Runner is on match point.<\/p>\n\n<p>I have been playing this deck for awhile and having a lot of success. Respect Inside Job against Criminals. Against Anarch and Shaper you can generally score Agendas early game (barring SMC). Against SMC, you want to have a Wisp in your scoring remote before you attempt a score. Recursion is obviously the deck's biggest problem. Shaper is by far the toughest faction to beat. Anarch is generally pretty easy, especially with Jacksons. I'd say this deck shines versus Anarch, can hold its own versus Criminal, and often has a tough time versus Shapers. Stealth Kit is a tough match-up, too.<\/p>\n\n<p>Knowing when and where to install Wisps is a big part of playing this deck. You can also use them as bait (tax Runner on remote, only to have them hit only Wisp and lose a breaker).<\/p>\n\n<p>Still on the fence about Targeted Marketing.\nChris didn't run Hunter; I cannot remember what I took it out for. It should probably be removed. Its purpose was never to turn on Scorched (obviously absent), but rather to potentially tag a Runner who recognizes the deck as Uncorrodable. My idea was that nearly every Runner faction and ID is playing at least a handful of Resources now, so the potential to tag them last click and kill a vital Resource is worthwhile. In hindsight, maybe it isn't.<\/p>\n\n<p>All feedback will be reciprocated! For those who don't play Weyland, I would recommend giving this one a shot. It is a very controlling deck, and thanks to all the ETR you generally feel pretty safe.<\/p>\n","username":"moistloaf","cards":{"01064":2,"01094":2,"01101":1,"01103":3,"01110":3,"01112":1,"01113":3,"02018":3,"02060":2,"02077":2,"03026":3,"04015":3,"04017":3,"04040":3,"04058":3,"04060":2,"04096":2,"04097":1,"04100":1,"04120":1,"06003":1,"06026":2,"06032":3}},{"id":10187,"name":"Val's Andy 1.5 standard","creation":"2014-10-26 06:47:38","description":"<p>Not my original:\nPrague October GNK Tournament - 10 participants, winner JuLiAn\nhttp:\/\/forum.stimhack.com\/t\/official-tournament-winning-decklists-page\/533\/645<\/p>\n\n<p>Just tweaking in an additional plascrete<\/p>\n","username":"valbaca","cards":{"01007":2,"01008":3,"01011":1,"01014":1,"01018":3,"01021":2,"01022":3,"01024":3,"01026":1,"01050":3,"02009":2,"02043":2,"02083":1,"02085":2,"02091":1,"02104":2,"02105":1,"02107":3,"03052":3,"03054":1,"04004":2,"05046":1,"05048":3}},{"id":10188,"name":"Ken: Express Testing","creation":"2014-10-26 09:26:27","description":"<p>Standard Prepaid-Ken setup with a few rather unusual card choices:<\/p>\n\n<p>1) Retrieval Run: I chose this card over clone chip because if you can make this run work it can get you pretty much any program for 2 credits, 1 if you have desperado out or even entirely free with the voicepads assuming the archives are unprotected. <\/p>\n\n<p>2) Express Delivery: I haven't found any deckspace for the much needed shaper draw so at least I decided to make some space for a little in faction draw.

The reasoning is this: if you sacrifice a <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04120\">Quandary<\/a> you can't go wrong, it'll always be something better or at worst the very same.<\/p>\n\n<p>Sometimes a good mutation can drastically change the game, for example he got a <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04120\">Quandary<\/a> mutated into a <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01090\">Tollbooth<\/a> on R&amp;D (and it had strength 7 by that time of the game)... so no <strong>dilemma<\/strong> about it, <strong>just do it!<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<hr \/>\n\n<h1>What to fear \/ not to fear<\/h1>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"\/en\/card\/01043\">Gordian Blade<\/a> is your #1 enemy. With a strength that stays for the entire run, there's little advantage in stratification too. That's why you should try and keep a <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01090\">Tollbooth<\/a> for the scoring server, so it'll always cost some more no matter what.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"\/en\/card\/03040\">Atman<\/a> can be a pain, at least in early game, because most of your ice has the same strength value: 4. You also have <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01111\">Enigma<\/a> and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04120\">Quandary<\/a> though, so they can help. Moreover, by scoring an <a href=\"\/en\/card\/06024\">Encrypted Portals<\/a> you completely screw with his Atmans, so another good reason to go for that Agenda first and foremost.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"\/en\/card\/04043\">Knight<\/a> is another big problem for this deck, since unless you score all 3 copies of <a href=\"\/en\/card\/06024\">Encrypted Portals<\/a> he will be able to pass any ice you have with it.\nIf he also uses <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01015\">Ice Carver<\/a> there's not much you can do about it. Just try to trash it when you can by installing another ice, so he'll at least have to install another one or recover that copy.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"\/en\/card\/01026\">Femme Fatale<\/a>, given the single subroutine you have on almost every ice can be annoying. Especially of course on Tollbooth. What you can and should do if <em>femme'd<\/em> is use <a href=\"\/en\/card\/06004\">Mutate<\/a> to change that piece of ice with something else. Anything will be better, or at worst the same since <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04120\">Quandary<\/a> will still cost 1 credit to pass.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"\/en\/card\/01014\">Yog.0<\/a> shouldn't be a big problem, since you have plenty of Ice that can screw with it even in early game. Just try to place <a href=\"\/en\/card\/06003\">Lotus Field<\/a> on central servers to stop him accumulating too many <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01008\">Datasucker<\/a> counters. Once you set your defenses on centrals and purge, he should have a really hard time passing anywhere.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>All in all, however, these problems are solved by using <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04114\">Caprice Nisei<\/a> and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02013\">Ash 2X3ZB9CY<\/a>, so in the long run your main concern is always the same: credits!<\/p>\n\n<hr \/>\n\n<p>P.S. no <a href=\"\/en\/card\/06031\">Lag Time<\/a> uh?

The meta then included Criminal reigning supreme, and Yog and Datasucker being in every deck (or Atman\/Datasucker).<\/p>\n\n<p>Skip ahead to August of this year. Will o' the Wisp and Taurus are released. In light of the Posted Bounty and Biotic Labor featured in my decklist, I cannot resist the play-making potential of these two cards. Lucky Find in Katman is now a staple and my deck is having trouble competing economically with it; Power Shutdown is only effective sometimes, depending on the timing of runner installs, because of Pre-Paid Voicepad being an early-play staple to their mid-game pressure. Will o' The Wisp seems a perfect way to deal with a Shaper that simply can't be kept out, while holding an unrezzed Swordsman on R&amp;D until rezzing it to trash the 4-strength Atman will buy me the score window I need. Decklist seen <a href=\"http:\/\/netrunnerdb.com\/en\/decklist\/8617\/keystone-v1-3\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>The deck is very effective, but the rise of NEH means runners learn to play faster, and to be able to punish a runner who moves quickly, I simply need more splash. Too often a Decoy or NACH hits the table, and I stare at the SEA\/Scorch\/Scorch\/Biotic in my hand and shrug; Now I have to Biotic score a Posted Bounty, forfeit it to blow the Decoy, then still have the money to SEA\/Scorch\/Scorch next turn, and this is assuming no Plascretes (But you're Weyland, so there'll be Plascretes). I need the ability to take my deck in whatever direction I need to, at any time; The Scorch play is too difficult to threaten without crossing the event horizon into Flatline Committal territory, where you lose potential scoring windows hoping for them to run carelessly, and instead they Plascrete, they take 8, they clear Kati, they Index you, and there's your chance. I need 15 influence, I need more power cards, and most of all I need the ability to get money quickly to not fall behind and stay behind after rezzing a Grim force a Faerie to pop just to save time. <\/p>\n\n<p>The deck becomes so difficult to pilot that I actually switch to PE for a couple tournaments, just for the heck of trying something new; Something silly that runs 8 ice, Tori Hanzo, House of Knives, Cerebral Casts, Scorches, and Neurals. I take second because a lot of Andromeda \"run all the time\" decks show up and they get careless, but I just didn't enjoy myself that much. I miss laying a Weyland identity on the table, and the very idea of green cards forcing the runner to respect me. I miss the power. I miss the punishment cards. DO NOT STEAL FROM ME. Power Shutdown for 0, trash the Faerie. Install the Atlas. Advance. Score it out next turn. Now I have a Scorch on demand. R&amp;D has an Enigma on it. Help yourself. See what happens. I LOVE this style of play. Building towering servers of ice is slow, and someone like me with ADD needs more action. NBN is un-interactive; and RP, once again, is just so damn slow.<\/p>\n\n<p>Then Blue Sun is released. For someone who has only played Weyland, since Creation and Control was released, wow, this solved so many problems Weyland has had up to this point:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Weak late game<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Dependency on combo cards<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Enigma and Quandary are your only code gate options without using influence<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>High-economy runners mean if you don't get to match point in time, you'll never be able to Scorch them; at match point Punitive is ineffective.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Rush deck ice is cheap and binary, a rough thing to pilot in a meta where Parasite is everywhere<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Faerie and Sharpshooter always hit the table in the first few turns, neutering any possibility of Archer making plays for you without a Corporate Troubleshooter; Dumping your credits into a CT often means a runner with a good economy will overtake you if you are not using your CT at match point<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Weyland economy depends on scoring agendas; Hostile Takeover and Geothermal Fracking (although everyone has convinced themselves they would rather have a leg amputated than take more than 1 Bad Pub), and to a lesser extent, Government Contracts. Govt Contracts is a fantastic agenda, but nearly impossible to score (in my southwest Ohio meta, there is an inside joke with my deck about Government Contracts; it's there for you to take so that I can score the 'good' agendas), and if you do score it, it's usually pulling out all your tricks to do so (rezzing the Archer, pumping a CT, or just them letting you have it and then Indexing you for 4 points or Siphoning you to disarm the CT and then running it anyway), and leaving yourself high and dry for several turns while you use it's ability of \"spend most of your turn to get a Hedge Fund\". If you're in a position where you can spend 2 clicks for 4 credits, the runner has already lost, and you should have just scored an over-advanced Atlas to search for 2 Hostile Takeovers\/1 HT and another Atlas to just close the game out.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Most of all: Blue Sun allows you to rez 'utility' ice, i.e. ice that is perhaps not binary but serves a strong purpose in advancing your board state, without having to actually SPEND that money. Ice that has a great effect, but once you rez it, fires once, and that's the end of it. No more surprise, barely taxing, or you're too low on credits and you just opt to not rez it at all, because if you do, you can't rez the Enigma or Archer behind it without being at 3 credits (a number Weyland NEVER wants to be at all game!) and getting exploited on some other server.<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>I have been following Blue Sun closely in forums, seeing what people are trying to do with it, but for the most part, they're just trying to copy other glacier decks, insistent on parroting the \"taxing decks are winning decks\" mantra that started with Red Coats and now dominates in RP and NEH; Hadrian's, Curtain Walls, Wotans, Heimdalls, whatever, with things like Eliza's Toybox or Adonis Campaign to bounce so every turn you gain credits. I was thrilled at the idea, though, of applying my Keystone skeleton to an identity that would literally solve EVERY problem with it in its 10-influence GRNDL version.<\/p>\n\n<p>This was meant to be a \"these are all the cards I think will be effective\" proof of concept deck, but it worked MUCH better than I anticipated it would. Resilient to Parasite and Knight. Swordsman no longer needed because Datasucker is easily trashed with Power Shutdown, and if you want to play a 10\/14-str Atman, go ahead. A lot of cards present in this decklist are present in many Blue Sun decklists: Hadrian's and Curtain Walls and Oversight AI especially. But here are the MVPs of the deck, with some explanation:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Reversed Accounts<\/strong>: WOW. This card is completely bananas. 1 Influence? Yes please. Worried about whether or not they can break your remote? You have Archer there with (ideally) a Hadrian's in front (so when Corroder is trashed Inside Job must be used) and Enigma so they need all 3 breakers, they have a Faerie and a Clone Chip out with a Gordian Blade and Corroder. Hadrian's is 7 to break, Enigma 2 (conservatively 1 if running on last click), and Archer 4 and a trashing of their Faerie. 12 - 13 Credits, but with that Clone Chip you can't even bluff\/waste a Posted Bounty to create a score window because they can get the Faerie back. Instead, drop this in to create a scoring window. Install Advance Advance. Do they run it? Rez the Ice, make them burn their credits, on your turn bounce the Hadrian's to your hand if you must, and drop that Atlas. Do they not run it? Advance first click, rez, use it's ability 2nd click. They just lost 12 credits, the amount they need to get through your server. 3rd click, install the agenda. Score it out next turn. This is the trap Weyland has been waiting for, not Shattered Remains. Reversed Accounts.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Midseason Replacements<\/strong>: To hell with your tag avoidance. Steal from me? I have 30 credits. I don't have a problem dumping 15 into a Midseason on you. Spend all your credits to stop me. Or don't... You have 2 Plascretes right? What is Weyland gonna do to you? Close your Accounts? They have so much money, who cares. I'd rather let them waste 15 credits and try to win before they do. But if you're tagged, goodbye Supplier. Goodbye, Kati. Goodbye, Professional Contacts. Strangely, Compromised Employee is ABSOLUTELY worth trashing if they're tagged. You bounce and rez ice so often that with 2 or 3 of those out, the runner doesn't <em>need<\/em> economy. <em>You<\/em> are their economy. So 15 tags, so what? Here's what: They enter tag-me mode. They will keep 4 cards in hand. They have to click to draw or play burst draw cards now, and can't go all-in (unless at match point, which is, granted, not ideal for you to be playing Midseason at). A runner plays 2 Plascretes for the most part, and even while tagged, just keeps a hand of 4 unless they happen to even HAVE a 3rd Plascrete in their deck, let alone draw it. Why does this matter? That brings me to the next card.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Information Overload<\/strong>: Let's talk about 'taxing ice'. I can basically always Midseason you, even if it means having to bounce back a Curtain Wall I OAI'ed earlier. When I rez a piece of ice that says <em>Pay 15 credits or lose 15 installed cards<\/em>, what will you do? It only has to work once. My turn comes back around. Blue Sun it back. Get your 6 credits back. The runner has been punished for taking tags that they can't stop you from giving. Now shuffle the cards in HQ. Install a piece of ice where you think they will run next turn, if they were to run. Install a 2nd piece of ice on your remote. Install an agenda in that remote. Pass turn. Ok, Andy, where is the Information Overload? Make sure you run with enough credits to break the subroutines on the IO, or lose those Plascretes. I'm Weyland and I'm playing Midseason, you know I have Scorches. It's your call.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Taurus<\/strong>: Another great one-of, though I'm considering going to 2-of; It's 5 to rez, 3 to pump and force the trashing of 1 hardware <em>regardless<\/em> of if they match the trace or not. Then bounce it back, get 5 credits back. Shuffle your HQ, install a piece of ice back where Taurus was, and another piece of ice where you think they'll run. Where is the Taurus? Like I said, this deck absolutely does not fear Datasucker. That removes Mimic from the equation. The common sentry breakers to be aware of will be Femme and Faerie, (and possibly Dagger\/Switchblade depending on how the meta evolves from here) and both are things you <em>want<\/em> the runner to play. Waste a Faerie on a Taurus, that's 1 less Faerie for Archer or Grim. Femme'ing ice is nearly impossible to do versus this deck, because I will just bounce what you Femme. Hard-breaking a Taurus with Femme is 7 credits, that's fine too. The runner doesn't want to play Femme when you are bouncing sentries back to your hand, shuffling, and dropping 2 ice. They have to face-check it to know what to Femme, and the only pieces in this deck they would Femme (outside of Archer) get bounced after they're rezzed, so what they essentially have in their deck is an extremely cost-inefficient 9-cost Sentry breaker. Spend 9 Credits when it costs 10 - 12 to break in to this remote. Guess what's going to happen if you steal from me when we're running a 20-credit disparity? Taurus trashes Desperado early, reliably, which puts the choke on Security Testing Andy; It trashes Clone Chips reliably or forces the Shaper to SMC for a sentry breaker when they don't want to. It trashes the belligerent turn 1 runner Plascrete, if you have the extra 3 credits to spare. At any point in the game, it is a great 1-of. Or better yet, don't rez it, let them run in with the SMC out. My turn? Power Shutdown for 0. 1 Credit to remove your ability to tutor a breaker to save you during your next run. You might see my top card and know I just drew an Archer; I'm Weyland, of Course I have an Archer. Now go draw for a card to deal with it because I just installed 2 ice and 1 of them is an Archer. Or is it? Play a Faerie and run, because it's an Ice Wall and an Enigma. My turn? Power Shutdown for 0. <\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Jackson Howard<\/strong>: One of the MVPs of the deck, and not just because Jackson has been a fantastic card for 95% of all corp decks for almost a year and going. Here is a small list of what Jackson lets you do:<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>-Power Shutdown safely<\/p>\n\n<p>-Dig for combo cards (obviously)<\/p>\n\n<p>-Overdraw to deal with agenda flooding (obviously)<\/p>\n\n<p>-Bait the a runner familiar with the deck into a run by bluffing an Atlas, Hostile Takeover, or Posted Bounty<\/p>\n\n<p>-Especially: You're 10 turns in and you've only seen 1 Shutdown, and you're hurting for one. Put the Shutdown back in, upping the odds of getting one. Along with it, put those Oversight AIs back in. Each one is essentially a click for 10 - 14 credits if left uncontested for a single turn.<\/p>\n\n<p>-You've just hit them with Midseason and stuck them with enough tags that they can't clear for several turns (somewhere between 8 and 12 probably). You're holding 3 Scorches. They have 2 Plascretes and 4 cards in hand. Play the Scorches. They probably won't be running any time soon. Sure the Scorch threat is gone, until you rez a Jackson Howard and put all 3 Scorches back in. What does a runner do with that? Most will say they aren't sure; most will say \"go hard and try to win before they draw them back\". Do you have an Atlas Token? Once you draw 1, you win. Atlas search for the other, and 8 meat damage later the game is over. More on this below.<\/p>\n\n<p>-Biotic Recursion. You have the Biotic, you're holding an Atlas. Your primary objective is to get that Atlas on the table, unadvanced, in a scoring window if you can. The runner should not be able to run your remote without disparity growing to about 20 credits anyway, which brings the Midseason into the picture, but we've covered that. If they don't run it, Biotic Labor, advance 4 times. Now you're at 3 points (unlike previous Keystone variants, I'm finding it's actually quite helpful to score your first HT early since you start at 5 credits instead of 10 like in GRNDL); a Biotic in Archives, and waiting on a Jackson. Jackson draw for another agenda. Is it an Atlas. Jackson the Biotic back in, Atlas search it, and score the Atlas out of hand if you have to. Or install unadvanced into a remote, then go for Biotic and churn another Atlas with a token out. You're at match point with huge ice on the board and the ability to get any card you want. You're in a good place. More on the plays Biotic opens up below.<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Biotic Labor<\/strong>: A power card, the downside of which is its cost. But in an archetype where the theme is basically \"money is no object\", it fits perfectly. There are basically 2 reasons for Biotic; First, as mentioned above, letting you chain Project Atlas. Atlas is the cornerstone agenda of ANY Weyland deck right now (until OaC of course, and probably still beyond that). It is Weyland's Astroscript. Not overadvancing this is basically not an option. It might have well have been printed as a 4\/2 that gets a token on scoring it out, but it is better than that: Every advancement beyond the 3rd gives you an Atlas token, meaning scoring it as if it were a 5\/3 gives you the ability to have 2 cards out of your deck, ANY CARD, any time you want. That effect is WORTH 4 credits. If there was a card that was cost 4 and said <em>When you play this operation gain a click. This card may be played during the runners turn during any paid ability window. Search R&amp;D for any card, reveal it, and add it to HQ. Shuffle your deck.<\/em> Would you play it? Are you kidding me? Of course you would, that card sounds completely bananas. Using Biotic as a 4-credit means to get cards out of your R&amp;D when you need them is ALWAYS, I mean <strong>ALWAYS<\/strong> worth it.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>-Minor secondary use of Biotic: You have a giant amount of credits. The runner has not installed plascrete, and perhaps they don't even run them because of NEH being so prevalent and Scorch decks becoming more uncommon. You have had some strong draws, and have 20 - 25 credits from bouncing Hadrian's\/Curtain Walls. The runner has been less fortunate, and doesn't want to risk running against you just yet, because they know you can bounce a big barrier if they run and score against you and smash you the tag\/scorch\/scorch combo you might be holding. But what you DO have in hand, as coincidence would have it, is a Posted Bounty, a Biotic, and a Single Scorch. Install the Posted Bounty on your first click, then do other things; Perhaps ice up centrals, or OAI a Curtain\/Hadrian's Wall, play a Hedge Fund, continue to set up your centrals and your late-game economy. What does the runner do on their turn? Likely, set up their rig. Or, run a central to force some ice rez\/economy denial to help close the credit gap, then jack out, so they don't get the successful run\/SEA Source. Even a smart player will think, \"what could that be? He didn't advance it after installing it. I know he will want to overadvance his Atlas, and can't afford to lose it, so it must not be that. Weyland does not have access to any other 3\/2 agendas. Is it a Profiteering or Chronos Protocol perhaps? At worst, it's only 1 point, and not worth getting Scorched over. Even if it's a Posted Bounty, I have another turn to close the credit, can advance it three times next turn, and then the turn AFTER that he can forfeit it to hit me with Scorches. I'll econ up this turn, and wait to see if it gets advanced, and then run it if it does.\" With PB sitting naked behind that remote ice, you can Biotic, triple advance, and single Scorch in a turn. Alternatively, if they DO run it regardless of it being unadvanced, they just took the agenda you want the least in the deck, and turned on Midseason, and likely spent a few credits getting in, meaning bouncing a big barrier will ensure a tagstorm. Jackson draw for the scorches ASAP and smash through their Plascrete and close the game out.<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Targetted Marketing<\/strong>- Wow is this card great for this deck. 10 Credits is the PERFECT amount, because it means you can hard rez a Hadrian's which means you have a (likely) 7-credit taxing barrier that can be liquidated back into 10 credits if ever the need should arise. It didn't require an OAI, waiting a turn, hoping they don't derez it, etc. Don't play this first turn. Once you have enough ice out that the runner needs to start playing cards, play it. 3rd round of swiss in the tournament I just won, a runner overdrew with Professional Contacts early on in the round, digging for another breaker or tutor after I used a Power Shutdown to trash his SMC 3rd turn. After overdrawing, he discarded Ghost Runner (he was playing Chaos Theory) so on my turn (with 2 Enigmas guarding R&amp;D and HQ) I played Targetted Marketing and named Refractor. 3 turns later he had no choice but to play the Refractor and give me the 10 credits. Once again, it only has to work once, and then it's 1 click for 10 credits. I'll take it. Alternate things to name: Emergency Shutdown, Inside Job, Same Old Thing, Test Run, Clone Chip. You are a program trashing machine, so recursion cards are an easy one to name. Your big credit-generating barriers are vulnerable to Emergency Shutdown, so that is another strong card to name if playing against a Criminal. Sneakdoor\/Inside Job to HQ and then play Emergency Shutdown on the Hadrian's I have on HQ. That's conservatively 2 clicks and 2 cards to deny me 10 credits, and in doing so, you give me 10 credits. I would like to find space for more of these because drawing it late game (happened once during tournament) means it serves little use.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p><strong>Possible Changes<\/strong>: <\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Targetted Marketing did great work, and 10 credits synergizes so well with your bread-and-butter 'economy' card: Hadrian's Wall. Unsure of the direction to take the deck in, considering influence constraints, though. I could go for a three-of by cutting Information Overload, but with Atlas, Information Overload does SO much work when the Midseason lands. Will continue to play test, but running a 1-of for 1 influence is really not bad as-is. It's nice when I draw it, and almost always useful, except at match point, and even then, sometimes useful when the economic battle is neck-and-neck and you are both at match point. If you've been controlling their board state through Power Shutdown and Destroyers you should be able to think of something to name that the runner will need, which will give you the 10 you need to rez the Hadrian's guarding your agendas, wherever they are.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>I could not believe the power of Midseason Replacements in this deck. Any of you familiar with previous Keystone Variants using GRNDL know that I'm a huge advocate for a single Biotic labor in Weyland rush decks, but wow, the consistency that a second Midseason would bring to the table would be devastating to a runner. Conversely, though, having 2 dead draws at match point taking up 8 influence is less than optimal and funnels you into an early game kill-or-be-killed strategy, which is not what this deck is about. Instead of running 1 SEA and 1 Midseason, running 2 Posted Bounty along with a single Biotic gives me more options, options that do not depend on having more money than the runner through a trace like both SEA and Midseason do, and more importantly, can spring a Scorch at you from seemingly nowhere using a power card like Biotic Labor that as it stands now is only used to fast-advance agendas. The utility of Biotic Labor is simply unmatched in this deck when you considering, for all intents and purposes, that money is no object.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Elizabeth Mills made very little impact, other than a couple of runners in the tournament saying \"Wow, that's a pretty awesome interaction\" to me as I melted away 2 Bad Pub from a Geothermal Fracking I had scored earlier and taken the 14 from. As with all previous Keystone variants, bad pub did not matter. The idea was, you can have bad pub, you won't have anything to spend it on in your runs because you don't have the right breakers, because I keep trashing them. When a server costs 12 to get through, making it cost 10 instead does not matter, when Midseason and Reversed Accounts are online. This deck is so so potent, Bad Pub is inconsequential, because a mistake still means your death or me scoring out, regardless of the adorable 3 credits you'll have for this run. At no point in the tournament did I have more than 3 bad pub, and 3 in only 1 game, the rest of the games, 2. This will definitely be cut, but for what, I am unsure. I really enjoyed the power of Taurus, so I may consider a second one in place of E.M.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>On Geothermal Fracking vs. Corporate War: The synergy of Corporate War is undeniably great with Blue Sun, and in a more Glacier-centric deck, I feel it is a better fit than Geothermal Fracking. However, Corporate War can require you to bounce a piece of ice at the beginning of the turn you score it out to get its credit benefit. Granted, so what, because you get 7 credits for FREE and don't have to spend any additional clicks. <em>However<\/em>, for this deck Geothermal is better. You do not gain the clickless 7 credits, but instead you have access to <em>fourteen<\/em> credits at the cost of two clicks; fourteen credits that cannot be taken from you by any card currently in print. They cannot be Siphoned from you, they cannot be taken from you when you spend 10 of your last 15 credits on a Hadrian's the following turn on HQ as your criminal opponent Siphons you to force a rez, and then Emergency Shutdowns the ice. Geothermal is a recovery tool. It gaps you over from Atlas to Atlas, it gives you back the money that is being deprived of you as your Shaper opponent tutors for a D4v1d and breakers the OAI Hadrian's, or your criminal opponent Inside Job\/Emergency Shutdowns it. With Midseason in hand and Geothermal Fracking scored, they need to have (let's throw a number out) 14 credits more credits than you when they take an agenda from you, something that is borderline inconceivable, since you could bounce a piece of ice, pull 2 Geothermal tokens (being ridiculous here for the purpose of driving home a point), and Midseason last click as you have (15, 20) more credits than them. The credit swings are just so strong for this deck when using Geothermal Fracking; once again, the money from Fracking is 'safe', stored 'offshore' until it is needed. With those tokens you always have the money for a 10-str 3-subroutine barrier in a pinch.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Using 3 Enigmas as the only code gate in the deck was a great idea, and really the only sensible one. Quandary dies instantly to parasite, so with it out of the picture, it's also the obvious choice. I used these to great effect during the tournament, rezzing the same Enigma on a different server each time against a whole variety of different runners at least 3 times per game, which is almost a whole turn lost through the course of the early-to-mid-game stretch. Getting it early is incredible when you have so much program destruction; while Gordian Blade is not feasible to Power Shutdown, it costs 4, and with Grim and Archer (and Taurus) floating around, all unrezzed, the Faerie or Clone Chip you play to protect it will be hit with a Power Shutdown, or a rezzed Taurus\/Grim to force you to use it, so that the Gordian Blade doesn't stick around for too long. At a cost of 4, it provides a nice tempo hit for you to work with. Other popular code gate breakers being Yog, which is dealt with the same way (out of faction anyway) or Passport, easy to Shutdown at a cost of 1. With Corroder still being very popular (for now anyway, Blue Sun's presence might change that), it's actually not a high-priority target for Power Shutdowns (although I won't pass an opportunity if it presents itself) because Corroder equals 10 - 12 credit runs, and the Faerie\/SMC\/Passport\/Clone Chip that is played along-side it is an obvious target to keep the Enigmas doing work.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Hades Fragment is such a strong ability, but like I touched on at the outset of this article, 3-pointers are SO hard to score as Weyland. You really can't afford 2 full turns of advancing in this style of deck without bouncing\/shuffling\/installing ice to keep the threat present. A single 3-pointer is necessary to get the agenda points up to the 20-21 level, so I thought, hey, this is perfect. Scoring this puts OAI, Biotic, Power Shutdown, Reversed Accounts, Hedge Funds, trashed Hadrian's\/Curtains, all kinds of good things back into R&amp;D and ready for Atlas to come get them, or for me to Jackson shuffle them and try to draw them. In practice though, it's a cute idea, but I would rather go all-in on a single copy of The Cleaners. Pri-Req might seem an obvious choice, but I don't want a 3-pointer that I have to hold while I get a piece of ice set up that I can score to rez, while having enough economy and board state that if I DON'T Pri-Req rez it, I'm still ahead. The Cleaners means a triple Scorch is a Flatline through 2 Plascretes. THAT seems like the kind of 3-pointer that would fit this deck. Not something I need, but if I score it, it's always on. In a deck where money is not terribly hard to come by, that uses Midseasons to stick the tags, this seems like the way to go, if any. If I don't draw it, whatever. If it gets scored, fine. If I think I have an opportunity to score it, sure, I'll go for it, because I'll know whether or not my board state will allow me to recover in the event it gets stolen. <\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Weaknesses<\/strong>: De-rez effects, cards that efficiently break large ice (Knight, Breach, D4v1D). I do not foresee \"Lady\" Cerberus H1 being an issue; at 4 cost and only 3 strength, with 4 uses to it, a Curtain wall is 4 (installed) + 7 (boost) and 3 counters to break, for a total of 11. Spend 11 to keep me from getting 14? No problem. The 4 strength also means on-the-board recursion (Clone Chip) are easy targets for Power Shutdown; although Scavenge and Test Run would take some thought to play around. <\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Breach is very cost-effective, and great for denial of credits from OAI, but is not played often. Adding a single Breach to your deck is a strong option for a Blue Sun matchup. This will mean the battle will be over control of sentry breakers through Grim\/Archer\/Power Shutdown, or installed a Hadrian's in front of a Curtain wall on HQ, then OAI'ing the Curtain wall, to force an Inside Job or to force the large credit expenditure to break Hadrian's AND Curtain Wall. This leaves your archives vulnerable (likely) to a Sneakdoor\/E.Shutdown combo, but this will be inevitable against any criminal matchup; You have to be sure you have enough economy in your credit pool or on the board to be able to bounce back from a de-rez effect.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>I had D4v1D recursion used against me to great effect during second round swiss by Exile, who would go out of his way to recur D4v1D and run through my OAI'ed ice to control my economy. I had not anticipated this weakness until it happened, and the first Curtain Wall he trashed with a D4v1D was a real shot to the gut. Knowing Exile tricks, I played a slow econ game while aggressively Jackson-digging for Power Shutdowns and Hedge Funds, and trashed his Clone Chips after he used SMC for D4v1D, which he used Scavenge on to replenish the power counters of. This kept him from easy access to his Opus, since his tutors were being trashed\/used to recurr D4v1D. Regardless, this is a card to be aware of, and is certainly the Anarch 'silver bullet' answer to how to pressure a corp with monstrous ice while having between 4 and 8 credits all game, since you're Anarch.<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Blue Sun lets Weyland do something they've desperately needed to do for a LONG time: Force a runner to run against them. A smart runner would just econ up and poke your servers, and it turned the Scorch off, and they finally draw Plascretes, or clear Kati for 18, and now you're hopeless. OAI in Blue Sun means you can say, \"Come steal from me. I'll kill you. If you don't run against me, I'll gain 14 credits at the beginning of my next turn. Then you'll have a BIGGER problem. Or you can risk me holding the kill combo and run through the OAI ice to deny the credits and then jack out; That turns on Power Shutdown (which requires a run but <em>not<\/em> a successful run) which I'll use to punish you for stopping me from gaining my credits.\" I've been playing Weyland a long time, and just like many other Weyland players, I saw the problems in the play style. HB did everything Weyland did, but better, just by being HB and splashing Weyland Cards (Punitive Flatlines are so much better when your ice is enormously taxing and you play a ton of 3 pointers, GRNDL Refinery is not something you 'need' in HB but is a powerful economy card\/run instigator, Power Shutdowns are great because HB has some of the best recursion cards in faction) and so even strong and dedicated Weyland players were running out of reasons to keep playing Weyland. Blue Sun is the reason to come back. The unparalleled versatility, the ACTUAL threat of a flatline and not just \"they played 2 Plascretes, the game is over because I haven't been drawing while I hold a SEA Source and 3 Scorches\", the incredible credit disparities you can force the runner into... <\/p>\n\n<p>All the pieces of the puzzle are there now, fellow Weyland Players. Time to pick yourself back up by your bootstraps and bring some representation back into your local meta. Give runners a reason to run those awesome-looking Plascrete alt-arts again.<\/p>\n","username":"ItJustGotRielle","cards":{"01059":1,"01094":3,"01095":2,"01099":3,"01101":3,"01102":3,"01103":3,"01110":3,"01111":3,"02018":3,"02079":3,"02116":1,"04015":3,"04017":3,"04020":1,"04037":1,"04058":3,"04078":2,"06009":1,"06026":1,"06027":1,"06066":1,"06068":1,"06071":1}},{"id":10207,"name":"Dial-a-Rig Stealth Kit","creation":"2014-10-26 19:20:10","description":"<p>What's a Runner to do?  Right now it seems that the upper crust of Corporation archetypes are quickly widening between extremes of Fastrobiotics, and slower archetypes like Jinteki RP, HB Glacier, and the new Blue Sun \"Post-Modernism\".

I don't know which is the right answer (indeed it's probably a local meta call based on what people in your area play) but this deck is an attempt at the latter option. <\/p>\n\n<p>I'm using Stealth Kit as the core because it gives both sides of consistent early attack and economically viable late-game in the same coin (playing into the idea that this deck wants to contest a wide number of matchups).

But, here are a few things that can ruin your day:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Oversight AI rezzed on R&amp;D - I haven't actually seen this yet, but theoretically it would wreck your proverbial shit.<\/li>\n<li>Caprice on R&amp;D - only seen it once, but you better hope you're good at the psi game<\/li>\n<li>A bunch of snares in R&amp;D - not a problem unless they trash a blackmail - then it's a big problem<\/li>\n<li>Unrezzed Elizabeth Mills - I've seen Blue Sun with Geothermal Fracking rez and replay Elizabeth Mills a lot - try to trash her before the corp realizes your plan. Thankfully she'll probably be in a unprotected remote server.<\/li>\n<li>NBM Fast Advance :(<\/li>\n<li>PE randomly sniping three blackmails out of your 30 card hand. Fuck you too, Octogn net damage applier.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<h1>What if they've played it before?<\/h1>\n\n<p>Well, there are all of the above issues. But most commonly, I'll see people assume that you're going to build up the entire game and not run, so they can just score out agendas behind an ice wall or something. Interestingly, you actually can run somewhat aggressively!<\/p>\n\n<p>Use your judgement, but running unrezzed (non-R&amp;D) ice is often fairly safe and costs them a lot of them while costing you resources that are fairly plentiful for you (clicks). Things to watch out for are tags and net damage if you have critical pieces in hand.<\/p>\n\n<p>Additionally, you'll notice the 2x overmind! Arguably, this should be a crypsis, but I prefer overmind. If they get arrogant and don't ice up a scoring server\/R&amp;D properly, this is enough to punish them and nab an agenda or two (at the cost of delaying your combo by a turn or two).<\/p>\n\n<h1>Results:<\/h1>\n\n<p>Octogn: Roughly 40-50%ish Octogn wins out of 20 or so games. Ideal opponents seem to be HB (without toybox), Replicating Perfection, and other glaciery type things - people will often freak out and ice things up 4 or 5 deep. Traditional Weyland kill decks are also great to play against, but it's important to get out City Hall early to avoid the potential Posted Bounty tag.<\/p>\n\n<p>Casual play: 75%ish wins in casual play out of ten or so games (several of them repeat players) - possibly a result of the population on Octogn being more skilled than the median card-shop goer?<\/p>\n\n<p>Tournament: 2 wins out of 5 games in a relatively competitive local tournament with ~25 people - in my defense, the first 2 games were against very good NEH Fast Advance players who went on to place highly, and the final loss was against a very good Weyland  player who posted bounty on the third turn and killed Rachael and Bagbiter. (Hadn't drawn City Hall.)<\/p>\n\n<h1>The future:<\/h1>\n\n<p>The upcoming bad pub Anarch runner has the potential to improve this deck a <em>lot<\/em> and free up a lot of card space. If that happens, a potential improvement would be to run 3x demolition run and 3x Kraken. Play the blackmails as usual, then destroy the ice in front, and then do a demolition run or two to discard their entire deck!<\/p>\n\n<h1>Comments\/Suggestions welcome - there's a lot to improve!<\/h1>\n","username":"easong","cards":{"01002":1,"01006":2,"01009":1,"01010":3,"01050":3,"02001":1,"02022":3,"02042":1,"02067":1,"02091":1,"02109":2,"03053":3,"03054":2,"03055":1,"04004":3,"04062":2,"04089":3,"05049":1,"05051":3,"05053":2,"06054":3,"06060":1,"06074":3}},{"id":10211,"name":"The Company 1.1","creation":"2014-10-26 20:15:28","description":"\n","username":"valbaca","cards":{"01064":1,"01086":2,"01088":2,"01090":1,"01093":1,"01094":3,"01098":3,"01099":3,"01101":2,"01103":3,"01110":3,"01113":1,"02018":3,"02019":2,"02060":1,"02077":2,"02120":1,"03027":1,"04015":3,"04020":1,"04040":3,"04058":1,"04100":1,"04117":1,"04120":2,"06003":1,"06009":1,"06071":1}},{"id":10213,"name":"Good Guy Weyland","creation":"2014-10-26 20:31:17","description":"<p>Use <a href=\"\/en\/card\/06048\">Crisium Grid<\/a> and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04038\">Off the Grid<\/a> to create scoring windows, then bring your OTG back to score your agendas.

So I will start by copy\/pasting the write-up of Entropy v1.2:<\/p>\n\n<p>Welcome to Noise. Run R&amp;D first turn, if they let you in, take a peak. If it's something you don't want to have, play a virus to trash it. Preferably Imp, because then you can run back in and trash the second card. So on and so forth. If you trash agendas early they will just get Jackson'ed back unless you run and steal them, which can be fine. You are still playing viruses you need, and the agenda density is going up in R&amp;D, and you have Medium and Demo Run. If you can break your way to R&amp;D, you should make sure you can KEEP breaking your way to R&amp;D. Still debating on whether to cut a Clone Chip for Hades Shard... currently through good piloting I can make precise archives runs and work around Jacksons by forcing them to be used while still building towards an R&amp;D critical mass.<\/p>\n\n<p>In the vein of Street Chess, this deck cycles Cache for money. Cache gives you 4 credits if you have a Grimoire out, and when your turn begins, 3 more. This means with Aesops and Grimoire out (which are NOT combo cards, since the entire deck depends on them\/utilizes them) you are getting 6 credits for 1 click, and you only need 1 credit to punch the card and get the payoff. If you go through 2 early, Deja Vu them back (if necessary)<\/p>\n\n<p>D4V1D immediately appeared to me to fit a Noise deck perfectly, because the only code gates that matter are easily parasite-able, or are Viktor 2.0\/Tollbooth\/Lotus Field. D4V1D allows you to break a surprise Tollbooth for 3 credits, and will let you straight up walk through an Archer in a pinch at the cost of letting the 2-Credit subroutine fire. Breaks Grim, Viktor 2.0, etc. Anything below 5 Str can be Parasite food that your Datasuckers will assist you with.<\/p>\n\n<p>Djinn ensures you get the viruses you need (trying to control variance by using it to get your first Cache is fine if you have the Aesops). This Noise deck actually runs quite often, and is built around punching through servers when needed, harrassing constantly, and dropping viruses when locked out in order to maintain disruption and pressure while building toward a board state that CAN punch through. This deck does not draw very often, every card is potent and helps you get something done. In this way I was able to avoid having to splash for draw or including Wyldside. The clickless economy assists with heavy pressure, since you have a full 4 clicks left to make runs and install programs and viruses.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Updates<\/strong>:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Dropped 2 Knight, cut 1 Mimic, in favor of a single Crypsis, which helped to open space for Wyldsides. Knight was my original answer to Lotus Field, the bane of Noise's existence, but after the addition of 2 Djinn (I'll cover this in a second), a single Crypsis in case of Lotus Field is a tutor-able answer that frees up deckspace and becomes more reliable.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Dropped 3 Queen's Gambit. This card is simply too 'all-in'. As my skill with Noise Cache increases I realize that I really don't NEED to spend 2 clicks gaining 6 credits, because I already gain 7 in 1 click with Cache. So I streamlined the deck to accomodate getting Cache, and other viruses, out faster. Less downtime, less 'cute' stuff.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Added 2 Infiltration. RP is abundant in our meta, and in particular, one of our core players plays an <em>incredible<\/em> shell game PE using Mushin No Shin, which he is nearly undefeated playing, and I was concerned about leaving Ronins on the table. Another player, who I ended up facing in the final round to decide who would take 1st and 2nd, ran a tagstorm NEH deck with Snares and Dedicated Response Teams (and Manhunt), so it seemed like a good decision.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Surge, while a controversial choice, is still making plays. Against NEH you can Clone Chip a Parasite onto the single Eli guarding R&amp;D as their turn ends, gaining a virus counter immediately with Grimoire, then another virus counter as your turn begins. Click 1, Surge the Parasite; basically a 1-click instakill of the best central ice in the game. You have 3 clicks to hammer R&amp;D with Medium and Demo Run now, or Imp, or even use Parasite with accumulated Datasucker tokens so as to save the Surge for Medium. Surge makes plays.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Wyldside made a huge different at getting me the cards I needed. I need viruses, I need Aesops. 3 Aesop's fits the bill, you want to take an opening hand with this and mulligan if you don't get one. 2 Wyldside was the right choice, this is a card I don't want to see until mid-game when I've set up my rig and started to cycle Caches and Parasites. <em>Don't<\/em> leave Wyldside on too long. You need 4 clicks! You don't want to turn into a mill machine. You want to exploit EVERY hole in Corp defenses, faster than they can plug them. No holes? <em>Make them<\/em>. Face check, Parasite, repeat, repeat. Afraid to face check? Djinn for a Crypsis (if you must) if it makes you feel safe. They'll rez the ice knowing how taxing Crypsis is to the runner; little do they know, you won't be using that Crypsis. You'll be destroying the ice while getting mills.<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Strive to mill at least 1 thing each turn, Aesop's one thing every turn to keep your econ up, and make at LEAST 1 run a turn. Be aggressive, make them have to ice up. This works to your advantage, because your mills are trashing ice as well. Check archives <em>often<\/em>. Did you just play 3 viruses for your first 3 clicks? Check archives last click. Get Datasucker tokens, find out what you milled, count their splash, track what ice they're using, look at the cost of the ice. Are you milling a lot of cheap ice? Then if the deck is well-built, due to their ice cost curve, they'll have primarily expensive ice leftover, Heimdall, Tollbooth, Hadrian's, etc. These clues can let you decide what you need to pitch when you inevitably overdraw with Wyldside looking for <em>something<\/em> and have to trash a card. Lots of high strength ice in archives? Pitching a D4v1D is a safe bet. You can always Clone Chip it. <\/p>\n\n<p>Clone chips are best saved for power plays, or to recurr lost breakers. Power plays being, parasite your way to an open R&amp;D in a single turn, and after access, Clone Chip an Imp (mill the top card), run back in (seeing 3 cards instead of 2 with Medium), Imp trash the top card, run back in (seeing 4, 3 of them new cards), and so on, That's a 5 card dig to give you plenty of Aesop's fodder and force them to ice up. You know what they're drawing the next 3 cards for, is it ice? Watch where\/what they install. Now you know how many Datasucker tokens you'll need. Did they purge? Aesops the imp, run R&amp;D, surge, Demo Run R&amp;D, run R&amp;D. That's a 9-card dig. Noise. Makes. Plays.<\/p>\n\n<p>Enjoy the deck, it's not terribly diverse compared to other Noise Cache decks out there, and honestly this deck just takes a bit of practice to pilot. When I first started I just wanted to smash a bunch of viruses on the table and run Archives every so often, but this deck plays so much more beautifully when you approach it with finesse. You build to a point that <em>something<\/em> will happen <em>somewhere<\/em>, and you let the corp make a move. Then you go turbo-A.D.D. on a single server in a single turn and just can NOT be stopped. In between, keep their assets in check, mill often enough that they need to keep Jackson on the table or need to ice archives. Jackson does not counter Noise, Noise counters Jackson. Top tier decks are built around counting on those Jacksons now to dig for the Astro and get the chain started, or to save the Astro from archives after you mill it. That Jackson becomes reactionary against Noise, and that control is what you want. You want them to cringe every time they draw and it's an operation instead of a piece of ice or an agenda, because that means on your turn, the chance of nailing an ice\/agenda card goes up! <\/p>\n\n<p>Don't think like a shaper. Don't think like a criminal. Practice this deck, and even if you lose, go for the power plays. The power plays will be your \"light bulb\" moment, where you understand what the deck is capable of. After seeing that in action, just work backwards to early game to find how to efficiently get to that point while still maintaining pressure. Good luck, and enjoy the deck!<\/p>\n","username":"ItJustGotRielle","cards":{"01001":1,"01002":3,"01003":2,"01006":2,"01007":2,"01008":3,"01009":2,"01010":1,"01011":1,"01012":3,"01016":2,"01047":3,"01049":2,"01051":1,"02003":2,"02009":2,"02022":3,"02041":1,"02081":2,"03038":3,"06033":2,"06037":3}}]

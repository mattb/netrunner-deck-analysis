How do you deal with FA decks?' That is what <a href=\"\/en\/card\/03043\">Chakana<\/a> and the <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01012\">Parasite<\/a> \/ <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01008\">Datasucker<\/a> combo was born to do. Use your sucker tokens, parasites and clone chips to expose the centrals to repeated hits, keeping the corp in phase 1 while you steadily clock Chakana tokens and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02106\">Indexing<\/a>s, <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01036\">The Maker's Eye<\/a>s and (at the very least) random accesses.<\/p>\n\n<p>Here's a horrible secret: Chakana is far more terrifying than it is actually threatening. If you get one on the board when the corp is starting to set up an early scoring remote, they almost always immediately abandon all plans and start icing R&amp;D. Take this opportunity to hit HQ a few times for sucker tokens \/ accesses, then switch back and forth as necessary. If you get Chakana running, take the inevitable virus clear as a sign to start hitting HQ, or to build up to hit the underprepared remote. Best case scenario, they try to soldier on despite Chakana and weigh down their entire <\/p>\n\n<h4><strong><em>Specific Card Choices<\/em><\/strong><\/h4>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"\/en\/card\/01041\">The Toolbox<\/a><\/strong>: I know it's an unpopular choice, but it rolls three things this deck desperately needs together into two card slots: links, MU, and recurring credits. <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01035\">Modded<\/a> is primarily there to help get The Toolbox out for 5c with Kate's ability, and even if you don't see them both together, you usually have plenty of cash in this deck to get it on the table.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"\/en\/card\/02007\">ZU.13 Key Master<\/a><\/strong>: It's cheap, it's got good synergy with the links in the deck, and it's versatile. That said, it's also expensive to run, vulnerable to power shutdown and sketchy against high-strength code gates. Despite that, its cheapness is definitely worth it with the current prevalence of <a href=\"\/en\/card\/05016\">Inazuma<\/a>-based kill decks, as you can <a href=\"\/en\/card\/03046\">SMC<\/a> into it and break the subroutine allowing you to jack out for 7c (with Kate's ability) vs 9c for Gordian Blade. That's not much, but against a kill deck it's important.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"\/en\/card\/04008\">Motivation<\/a> \/ <a href=\"\/en\/card\/05054\">Oracle May<\/a><\/strong>: I really can't stress enough how good this draw engine is once it gets running. Costing only 1c &amp; two clicks (3 with <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04004\">Hostage<\/a>) to get going, you make your money back fast and it gets you through phase 2 quicker than most corps are expecting. Oracle May also has obvious synergy with <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02047\">Test Run<\/a>, and since you want to play her as soon as you see her in most cases, this gets your rig running quick.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"\/en\/card\/03038\">Clone Chip<\/a><\/strong>: Hail mary MVP for facechecking towards the end of phase 1. Honestly, I feel like any parasite deck ought to be running three of these by default, as installing parasites on the fly is incredibly useful and will save your skin multiple times. If I can get 2 datasuckers up quickly, I'll hit Archives 3 times (because it's so rare to see any meaty protection on there vs. Shaper) and then facecheck any ice on the table.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"\/en\/card\/02106\">Indexing<\/a><\/strong>: We all know Indexing into Maker's Eye wins games, but even beyond that, it has great synergy with Chakana and the slowdown game generally. Be prepared to hide agendas two or three deep and then count the draws to know when they're on top or in HQ. Corps often assume that if you don't immediately hit R&amp;D after Indexing that you saw nothing but ice and operations; make them pay for that by setting up to steal an NAPD in three turns rather than immediately.<\/p>\n\n<h4><strong><em>Problems<\/em><\/strong><\/h4>\n\n<ul>\n<li>This deck requires you to be concentrating at all times. There are usually five or six different ways to approach any game state, and all of them require a bit of planning, maths and forethought. That's hella tiring, so taking this to a tournament might mean you're too knackered to play right by the end of the day.<\/li>\n<li>You can't wear tags. Like, at all. Be wary of Midseasons and other tricks.<\/li>\n<li>If they manage to trash Oracle May with net damage or something, you have to Levy to get her back. You can go on without her of course, but where's the fun in that? Better to install her ASAP when she hits your hand.<\/li>\n<li>Getting stuck on one server = death. You've got to be ready to stick and move at all times, keeping up steady pressure on remotes and centrals so they don't know what you're up to. The biggest cause of losses with this deck, in my experience, comes from trying too hard to load Chakana or check a particular remote rather than consider other options.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Anyway! The most important thing is this deck is incredibly fun to play and I honestly think learning its ins and outs has made me a much better player. Hope y'all dig it. :)<\/p>\n","username":"bionicsheep","cards":{"01007":1,"01008":3,"01012":2,"01026":1,"01033":1,"01034":2,"01035":1,"01036":2,"01039":2,"01041":2,"01050":3,"02007":1,"02009":1,"02047":2,"02069":3,"02106":2,"03035":1,"03038":3,"03043":2,"03046":2,"03053":3,"03054":1,"04004":2,"04008":2,"05054":1}},{"id":6433,"name":"HB Brain Damage-amage-amage","creation":"2014-06-05 11:35:28","description":"<p>Just trying out a brain damage HB based on another deck, don't have 3 Neural EMP's though.

So i was excited to play with <a href=\"\/en\/card\/05029\">Ken \"Express\" Tenma: Disappeared Clone<\/a> when it came out. Not only you get 17 influence which is huge, you also get rewarded for playing run events.<\/p>\n\n<p>So my starting point was the idea, to run <a href=\"\/en\/card\/05036\">Planned Assault<\/a> with a lot of different run events, so that i had access to all of them while not having to play all of them as 3 of's. <\/p>\n\n<p>To go with that <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01018\">Account Siphon<\/a>, <a href=\"\/en\/card\/03052\">Dirty Laundry<\/a>, <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02106\">Indexing<\/a> and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01021\">Inside Job<\/a> are easy inclusions. I think <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02106\">Indexing<\/a> is much better early, while <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01036\">The Maker's Eye<\/a> can do some work in the late game since you only need to run once to see 3 cards. I also really like the other one-of's in <a href=\"\/en\/card\/05035\">Legwork<\/a> and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01004\">Stimhack<\/a>. <\/p>\n\n<p>With bigger ICE coming back, i think <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02043\">Emergency Shutdown<\/a> becomes a lot better, so i chose to play at least one, which can be used again if needed.<\/p>\n\n<p>Since running all the time is part of the plan, <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01024\">Desperado<\/a> is a natural fit. Since i don't aim to score <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02026\">Notoriety<\/a> or <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04081\">Quest Completed<\/a>, it should be much better than <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02064\">Doppelg\u00e4nger<\/a>. On top of that, i started with 3 <a href=\"\/en\/card\/05048\">Security Testing<\/a> and the first one turned out to be amazing. Since the second and third one are almost dead cards (they don't stack on a single server), i cut one of those. <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04009\">John Masanori<\/a> does great work here, because you need to draw cards, but you don't want to spend clicks to do it, so here is another perfect card for the deck.<\/p>\n\n<p>And with all the amazing events, 3 <a href=\"\/en\/card\/03054\">Same Old Thing<\/a> is a No-Brainer. It's worth noting, that <a href=\"\/en\/card\/03054\">Same Old Thing<\/a> makes every one-of better, because you can play it again from your heap.<\/p>\n\n<p>All the important run events are pretty cheap so i don't feel the need to run any hardware, that pays for events (<a href=\"\/en\/card\/04029\">Prepaid VoicePAD<\/a> or <a href=\"\/en\/card\/05038\">Public Terminal<\/a>). I actually started without <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01050\">Sure Gamble<\/a> in the first place, because i wanted to test a run-only economy. I realised though that sometimes, you just need the burst economy to get going.<\/p>\n\n<p>Concerning the breaker suite i felt like i needed efficient breakers, so i decided to go for an old-fashioned anarch breaker suite with <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01008\">Datasucker<\/a>, which also fits the plan to always run.\n<a href=\"\/en\/card\/02104\">Faerie<\/a> and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02066\">Deus X<\/a> were my choices for early game pressure, so that i can run without being afraid of any ICE. Since i don't want to spend to many slots on breakers, 3 <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01022\">Special Order<\/a> is the way to go and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/03038\">Clone Chip<\/a> makes sure, you don't lose because a breaker was trashed or lost to net damage. In addition, it works really well with <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01004\">Stimhack<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>The last card added was actually the <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01030\">Crash Space<\/a> which seems to be a better <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02009\">Plascrete Carapace<\/a> in this deck, since it can remove tags after a <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01018\">Account Siphon<\/a> and can help against a SEA Source, Scorched Earth, Scorched Earth turn by the corp.

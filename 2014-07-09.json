Read it there.<\/p>\n\n<p>Basic strategy, score a 4\/2 as soon as it is possible. If the runner steals the first one, no sweat they have either made your next <a href=\"\/en\/card\/05005\">Medical Breakthrough<\/a> cheaper to score or have drained their economy paying for a <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04119\">NAPD Contract<\/a> and opened a scoring window for another 4\/2 agenda. You want to get to 4 AP as quickly as possible so that the runner feels pressure to run your servers rather than sitting back counting their money waiting to pounce.

Normally, you can wait for a 4th click run and completely ignore this card and that really does suck in most decks.

Mushin No Shin allows for some pretty awesome plays in any faction-- Pick a card from HQ, Mushin it, and advance it once more. As long as expose is out of your meta (as it is for me), you can often score big agendas completely naked, allowing you to focus more on icing up your central servers. From my experience people are typically terrified of running on any quadruple advanced card, unless it's match point, for fear of an instant flatline. I often pick an agenda and a trap in my hand and randomly shuffle them before installing, so that not even I know which card I just installed.<\/p>\n\n<p>TRAPS:<\/p>\n\n<p>Junebug: Threatens instant flatline against anyone without Deus X, provided you have at least 1 credit<\/p>\n\n<p>Cerebral Overwrite: Severely limits anything the runner does and threatens flatline later on; 4 brain damage is nothing to sneeze at<\/p>\n\n<p>GRNDL Refinery: Not really a trap, but it's an advancable asset. With Mushin you can potentially get 24 credits out of this<\/p>\n\n<p>AGENDAS:<\/p>\n\n<p>Project Atlas: Overscored, lets you say \"I win\" down the line. You can grab SEA Source, Scorched Earths, more Mushins, you name it, exactly when you need them. With Jackson Howard on the table, you have access to anything you want in either R&amp;D or Archives. Another bonus is that you show it to the runner, so you can grab a trap\/agenda and Mushin for more mindgames.<\/p>\n\n<p>Hostile Takeover: Fast money and Archer Fodder<\/p>\n\n<p>Government Contracts: Helps with the money game<\/p>\n\n<p>The Cleaners: Makes Scorched Earth even scarier<\/p>\n\n<p>Posted Bounty: If they don't steal it, you can score it at the start of your next turn and potentially play 3 Scorched Earths, even if they're ahead in the money game<\/p>\n\n<p>ICE:<\/p>\n\n<p>Mostly inexpensive so we don't go broke. Ice Wall, Quandary, and Guard are great to place after a Mushin play early in the game if you expect expose capabilities. Getting an overscored Project Atlas, a Government Contracts, or The Cleaners early in the game gives a big advantage. Hunter is also very cheap to rez, and expensive to break, since most runners likely won't want tags against Weyland<\/p>\n\n<p>But we also have some heavier ice in Archer, Hive, and Hadrian's to defend R&amp;D\/HQ.<\/p>\n\n<p>I have yet to playtest this; comments and suggestions are appreciated!<\/p>\n","username":"turkishvancat","cards":{"01069":2,"01086":1,"01093":1,"01094":3,"01095":2,"01098":2,"01099":3,"01101":2,"01102":2,"01103":3,"01110":3,"01112":2,"02018":3,"02077":1,"03009":1,"04015":3,"04036":2,"04040":3,"04099":2,"04117":1,"04120":3,"05015":3,"05024":2}},{"id":7512,"name":"weyland teaching deck","creation":"2014-07-09 18:22:16","description":"<p>simple weyland deck for teaching new players. no tracing or tagging + the only damage is via rototurret or junebug. big 3-point agendas so that you have to build a remote server, and also so that the game doesn't take too long. all code gates within yog range to keep it simple.<\/p>\n","username":"bionicsheep","cards":{"01056":3,"01064":3,"01069":3,"01093":1,"01098":3,"01103":3,"01106":3,"01109":3,"01110":3,"01111":3,"01113":3,"02077":3,"03026":3,"04036":1,"04040":3,"04059":3,"04100":3,"04120":3}},{"id":7513,"name":"gabe teaching deck","creation":"2014-07-09 18:22:30","description":"<p>simple breaker suite, designed to be a companion to my teaching weyland deck - everything in there is broken efficiently by one of these breakers. lots of cards which encourage runs. tri-maf is there to teach about meat damage mostly when they wear tags from siphon, plus because it's a good economy card. sneakdoor because it feels super good for new players (and old players, actually) to chuck it down and start getting free HQ runs. i also picked Gabe rather than Kate because i feel like he more quickly delivers the immediately fun part of netrunner, e.g. running constantly and not giving an eff about anything.<\/p>\n","username":"bionicsheep","cards":{"01007":3,"01014":3,"01017":1,"01018":3,"01019":3,"01021":3,"01022":3,"01024":3,"01027":3,"01028":3,"01034":3,"01050":3,"03052":3,"03053":3,"05035":3,"05050":3}},{"id":7514,"name":"Virus Override 0.1","creation":"2014-07-09 19:45:33","description":"\n","username":"orc.dat","cards":{"01001":1,"01002":3,"01005":3,"01008":3,"01009":2,"01010":1,"01012":3,"01050":3,"02003":2,"02009":2,"02024":2,"02042":2,"02087":3,"02091":2,"02102":1,"03035":1,"03043":1,"03053":3,"03054":1,"03055":1,"04082":1,"05051":2,"06014":2,"06020":1}},{"id":7515,"name":"Ken Events Edit 1 - Ginseng version","creation":"2014-07-09 23:36:47","description":"<p>Temporary.<\/p>\n","username":"Ginseng","cards":{"01007":2,"01018":3,"01021":2,"01022":3,"01024":2,"01026":1,"01036":1,"01050":3,"02009":2,"02043":3,"02087":3,"02106":1,"03035":1,"03052":3,"03054":3,"04043":1,"04063":1,"05029":1,"05034":1,"05035":2,"05039":1,"05041":2,"05046":2,"05048":2}},{"id":7516,"name":"New Weyland - Mushin no Shin splash","creation":"2014-07-09 23:42:03","description":"<p>Temporary<\/p>\n","username":"Ginseng","cards":{"01084":1,"01086":1,"01093":1,"01094":3,"01095":1,"01098":3,"01099":3,"01101":2,"01102":1,"01103":3,"01104":2,"01110":3,"01111":2,"02018":3,"02019":3,"02117":1,"03026":2,"04015":3,"04017":2,"04020":1,"04036":2,"04040":2,"04058":2,"05015":3}},{"id":7517,"name":"Haas Learner","creation":"2014-07-09 23:50:13","description":"\n","username":"sammyseal","cards":{"01054":1,"01055":3,"01056":3,"01058":2,"01059":3,"01061":3,"01062":3,"01063":3,"01064":3,"01066":1,"01069":2,"01070":3,"01106":3,"01108":2,"01109":3,"01110":3,"01111":2,"03004":1,"03005":3,"03009":2,"03014":2,"03026":2,"05025":2}},{"id":7518,"name":"Kate Learner","creation":"2014-07-09 23:59:04","description":"\n","username":"sammyseal","cards":{"01033":1,"01034":3,"01035":3,"01036":3,"01037":3,"01038":2,"01041":1,"01042":3,"01043":3,"01044":2,"01045":2,"01046":3,"01047":1,"01048":2,"01049":2,"01050":3,"01051":2,"03037":2,"03038":2,"03049":3,"03052":3,"04086":1}}]

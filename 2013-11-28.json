[{"id":676,"name":"Turbo rig?  vHJ.1","creation":"2013-11-28 01:38:36","description":"Just an Idea I threw together with the concept of getting a rig together faster than the  corp can build up. The 3 Deus x really help with Jinteki and HB. Everything else is for just dropping and running to pressure the corp. No extra access so you're stuck with one card but if you can run constantly it shouldn't matter. redundant programs for recursion with Larla and continuing to fuel FLCC while you have you rig. Clone chips to get back parasites or key breakers.","username":"HepatitvsJ","cards":{"01007":2,"01008":3,"01011":2,"01012":3,"01034":3,"01050":3,"02007":1,"02046":1,"02066":3,"02087":3,"03033":3,"03035":2,"03038":3,"03040":3,"03046":3,"03052":3}},{"id":677,"name":"Exile and cie V2","creation":"2013-11-28 02:59:08","description":"My first deck, modified and much better.

It's yet to be seen. But new toys recently released have certainly helped playing it more fun.<\/p>\n\n<p>Ice Placement:\nThe name of the game is tax, tax, tax, and more tax. Surviving the early game is critical here. Against fast aggressive runners, you will want to get your ice set up ASAP in order make each run as expensive as possible. While your ice is porous, it is very taxing. Since there are only 8 agendas in the deck, the chances of them pulling an early Agenda are low, but it can certainly happen. Against criminals running Security Testing and Sneak Door Beta, that means you cannot leave a single remote or central server without ice. Icing Archives also becomes necessary when playing against Parasite &amp; Datasucker combos.<\/p>\n\n<p>An ideal central server ice placement starting from outside to in is: Ichi 1.0 - Victor 1.0 - Eli 1.0.  These three ice will form the core of your central servers. This is fairly cheap for you to rez throughout the game and will continue to tax the runner significantly all game. Against potential Account Siphon users, you want ice at least two deep on HQ as soon as possible. Against runners who have run-based economy (Gabe, Desperado, Security Testing), mid-to-late game actually becomes better for you because if you've set up your servers properly, they should not be earning any money per run, starving them of money.<\/p>\n\n<p>Celebrity Gift:\nA true MVP in this deck. It gives HB:ST the quick cash injection that it so badly needs, especially having to give up the powerful 1 free credit per install that HB:EtF enjoys. While Melange Mining fulfills largely the same role, it has the huge downside of needing to be protected for a turn. Since there are no tricks or mind games in this deck, most runners will run remotes if they think they can get in. And early game, they can click to get in, making Melange less reliable. Celebrity Gift doesn't have that same issue and drawing it early is great, since it means you'll be threatening Heimdalls right away. And while revealing your hand isn't ideal, in this deck, it's not too much of an issue. Your opponent should know what to expect when they see HB:ST.<\/p>\n\n<p>Eve Campaign:\nOnce you get a bit of a money cushion, you will want to set up a server for Eve as soon as possible. In the age of Desperado, Whizzard, and Imp (not to mention Security Testing, as mentioned above), leaving an Eve unprotected is often times no longer viable and a waste. However, I've found that one single taxing ice, such as one of the Victors, can often be enough of an economic hit that many runners won't take that plunge to trash unless they are very well off. If they leave your Eve up, you are set for money for the rest of the game. Also, Eve doubles as a place to dump your credits for Account Siphon protection.<\/p>\n\n<p>Enhanced Login Protocol:\nWhat a great card for HB:ST. If played early, it can be a real thorn in the runner's side for huge chunks of the game if they cannot find one of the 8 agendas in this deck. Combines well with everything.<\/p>\n\n<p>Project Wotan:\nIf you can score one early, you will be able to leverage it into a further scoring window.<\/p>\n\n<p>Inazuma:\nThis card is excellent and is one of your trump cards. Would love to include two of, but there simply isn't enough influence. A surprise Inazuma into ice that they thought they could break with clicks can be game changing (such as Heimdall or Ichi).<\/p>\n\n<p>Other cards not included:<\/p>\n\n<p>Caprice Nisei:\nI would absolutely love to include Caprice in this deck. An earlier iteration of this deck did indeed have her in. When you were all set up, she did incredible work, especially in combination with Enhanced Login Protocol. However, including her means sacrificing Celebrity Gift, thereby forcing you rely on Melange or other economic solutions such as Successful Demonstration. The problem with Caprice is when you're poor (which is not uncommon playing HB:ST), she really doesn't help as playing the Psi game becomes taxing for you - especially early game when every credit helps to rez ice. Overall, I just found that the consistency of getting big money from Celebrity outweighed Caprice's undoubted utility. And relying on a combination of Melange and Successful Demonstration is simply  more inconsistent and dependent on the Runner's actions.<\/p>\n\n<p>Overall, be prepared for long games where you win the war of attrition.<\/p>\n","username":"Tsampa","cards":{"01055":3,"01058":2,"01061":2,"01062":3,"01063":3,"01106":2,"01110":3,"02010":1,"02013":2,"02030":1,"02034":1,"02070":3,"02092":3,"02110":3,"03006":2,"03015":1,"03019":3,"04012":3,"04015":3,"04119":1,"05016":1,"06022":2,"06023":2}},{"id":9315,"name":"Headache 1.0","creation":"2014-09-06 20:29:26","description":"<p>Basically, Glacier up, all operation econ.

I figured that, I really wanted to keep his identity useful. That 2credits every turn that you're below on AP is killer.<\/p>\n\n<p>So, I thought pretty hard about it and realized. Okay, so you want to start off slow and gain money, almost begging the opponent to score an agenda before you even run at a piece of ice. So this means you're effectively putting the game into mid-game immediately after the first turn. (first turn can still be used to facecheck ice and stuff, just to see and make the corp think.)<\/p>\n\n<p>Now, what happens if I steal a bunch of 1 pointers or something? I thought, damn. I might be using a lot of creds to get in, and then not getting the bonus credits... So I thought back and realized that before-hand, I thought 'Data Dealer' was pretty terrible, like. Why would you ever want to forfeit and agenda for 9credits? Well, maybe if it's going to gain you 2 and it's not useful to you, then sure, try it! <\/p>\n\n<p>Econ-heavy operations to beat traces (thank you based 1 link strength), and using 3 hostages to get Kati\/Mr.Li\/Inside Man out. Mr Li is probably first on the list for me to get out. I need some card draw. Then you can just start installing compromised employees, Data Dealers, and Decoys to get those beautiful ice credits from Comp Employee (and be able to beat traces better!).<\/p>\n\n<p>Logos is perfect for the ol' spook. He wants to be down on agendas early, so using Logos can get you breakers or whatever you really want, it's the best tutor in the game for Good ol' Sterling. Of course I have 3 Special Orders also for getting Garrote\/Corroder\/Gordian or Yog out when needed.<\/p>\n\n<p>It also finds a use for Mass Install other than a Noise Mill deck. That way I can install a bunch of these connections in 1 turn, then use my Calling In Favors for a huge amount of money. (I mean, even 4 is better than a Easy Mark!)<\/p>\n\n<p>Some people might complain about Garrote, and if you do, you can run Femme instead, but I prefer the only 1 to boost the strength. It makes it a much better all-around Sentry breaker than Femme. Femme has the benefit of bypass and 1 less mem, but I'm not strapped for mem with this rig. <\/p>\n\n<p>I really like the idea of using HQ Int and R&amp;D Int for Multi-access. I should be fine on money to easily get these through and up and running. <\/p>\n\n<p>How this plays:\nBest opening hand include Econ, Logos, Hostage, Any breaker, and Special Order.  Best possible opening hand. You play your econ, run twice, HD and R&amp;D, find out what ice they are using, and play Logos. Next turn, you grab what you need with hostage (Econ or card Draw or Hardware install), you can chose to install it right then for no click or not, but I'd say keep it in your hand if you're strapped on cash. (unless it's Kati then just put her out and click her), then pull out your Special Order, get the breaker you need. <\/p>\n\n<p>Now here is where you can econ hard and get 2 breakers out. Chances are you will be able to break 66% of their breakers by having that breaker in hand first turn, and the breaker now. <\/p>\n\n<p>So with this killer opening hand, you get your console out, your first connection, two of your breakers in hand, and you've already ran twice. In only two turns! But of course, that's just best-case scenario and you'll have to be flexible as always.<\/p>\n\n<p>The biggest problem this deck would face is Program Destruction. Because, like.. literally there is no recursion.

I kept noticing a the runner often hitting Archives as their central run before hitting a remote, to keep me from getting my Subliminals back, or to fish out trashed agendas. Admittedly, maybe that's poor play on my part, as I wasn't playing enough ICE on Archives. However, @Dydra's original is light on ICE...when it's hard to come by, I'd rather not spend the money or click to install and rez there.  So instead, I dropped in 2x Shock! to increase the taxation of an Archives run.<\/p>\n\n<p>@Dydra tried to talk me out of this. I'm glad I didn't listen, because Shock! has been a hero in this deck...setting up a win situation when hidden in Archives, and scaring away runners when face up. Having them hit 2x Shock! while scoring 3-4 points from Archives is nice during those times you can only track down a single Punitive!<\/p>\n\n<p>Still running Hokusai in place of Ronin. Loving that call.<\/p>\n\n<p>I've been playing with the ICE build in this deck, as that's where it falls short for me. I can't quite get it to do what it should do (be taxing) beyond early game. This is my latest iteration, bringing in Hive as a taxing barrier, Shinobi as a tougher Sentry, a single Roto for an extra shot at Program trashing, and Whirlpool for fun...because having fun at the Runner's expense is what Jinteki is all about!<\/p>\n","username":"jeremyorion","cards":{"01064":1,"01070":3,"01072":3,"01075":1,"01076":1,"01077":2,"01090":2,"01106":3,"02031":1,"02032":3,"02059":3,"02094":1,"02095":2,"03027":1,"04013":2,"04015":2,"04020":1,"04054":3,"04073":2,"04074":2,"04079":3,"04093":1,"04114":2,"04115":1,"04117":1,"04119":3}},{"id":4273,"name":"Slamarchy","creation":"2014-04-17 01:25:37","description":"<p>I think it is odd how so many people import in Mimic, Corroder, Yog, and Suckers, yet a lot of Noise decks focus more on milling and not accomplishing much rather than running, running, and running!

But you can occasionally force the runner to pay out the ass if they face check a Caddie or a Viper over a ChiLo without the right breaker.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Bernice Mai + ChiLo<\/h2>\n\n<p>Costs five creds (almost always 7 because we're Making News) to avoid two tags. With TGTBT that's 3 tags, 1 of which is unavoidable. And with NAPD... just sit back and let the runner squirm for a second. Make sure you rez ChiLo first and before they access!<\/p>\n\n<h2>Scorch + Archived Memories<\/h2>\n\n<p>I like to think Bernice and Elizabeth \"Boom Boom\" Mills are old college gal pals. So if the opportunity ever presents itself, give her a call.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Private Security Force<\/h2>\n\n<p>I find these are so much easier to sneak out because of NAPDs. Not comfortable with including a second one. But if you do score one, it makes everything else much more threatening.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Private Contracts<\/h2>\n\n<p>Why not Melange\/Pad\/Marked Accounts? Pads and Marked Accounts are a little too slow for this deck and won't help dig you out of a hole (which you may very well find yourself in from time to time). Melange is too hard to protect and not as flexible as PC making it the comfortable middle ground. So long as you always leave yourself an insurance of 3 creds after investing in, say, sticking an expensive Bernice trace, you can rez PC and click your whole turn to recover.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Uroburos<\/h2>\n\n<p>The wild card. Pros: two base trace 4's. Cons: strength could be higher, expensive. I've cycled this card out with Flare and Snoop. I think Flare is too expensive but it almost always does me good when I do rez it. Snoop is fun and seeing the runner's hand is invaluable knowledge as this deck often scores agendas behind ice that doesn't hard end the run.<\/p>\n\n<h1>Match-Ups<\/h1>\n\n<h2>Standard Breaker Suites<\/h2>\n\n<p>Try to bait them into TGTBT's and NAPDs.

Pay attention to what resources they're installing; Masanori and Josh B are often sure signs of of these reckless banditos. They often won't go tag-me until they have a Plascrete but be wary of giving them tags regardless because of Data Leak Reversal. They don't often drop one on anything but click 1 so you won't know they have it until they're hitting you with it. Once the tags start to pile up, use your Psychographics to sneak a safe Astro or overscore a Beale. Save your Archived Memories to pull the Psychographics back instead of scorched.<\/p>\n\n<h5>Usual Suspects: Anarchs and Andy<\/h5>\n\n<h2>Runners with 1 Base Link<\/h2>\n\n<p>Don't forget about the Base Link!

General concept is if your opponent tries to do something, you put so much pressure in another place they have to make the decision on what they want to lose.  This is done in the form of noise\/DLR on archives, medium on R&amp;D, AS on HQ, and knight for remote sniping.

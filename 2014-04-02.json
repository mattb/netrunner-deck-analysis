I've switched grims for roto turrets in this version, added ash and removed blue level.  Blue level was fantastic in the deck for finding combo pieces, but I didn't need the money, and it would sometimes overdraw agendas (with 3 pointers its bad).  <\/p>\n\n<p>I use the big agendas to capitalize on scoring windows, you need only score 2 agendas out of the remotes.<\/p>\n\n<p>Punitive works very well, esp if the runner makes a double or triple R&amp;D dig and scores 6 or 4 points.  With less draw I'm not sure how effective it'll be (BLC really helped find these moving parts), but I think it'll still be fine as is.<\/p>\n\n<p>Agg Sec blows away breakers very well (at the Indy store champs I killed at least 10 programs, including every last breaker 1 criminal player had).  Once you've scored a 3 pointer, aggsec does work.<\/p>\n\n<p>Hive is a decent add for early protection, since you're not scoring many points before the game ends.<\/p>\n\n<p>The big piles of cash also scare the runner with the looming threat of sea source scorch, so there is minor bluff factor in that.<\/p>\n\n<p>I've given up on this for the time being so I thought I'd share it out.

Use the X-level clearances, the Anonymous Tips, and even Jackson Howard, although <em>NEVER<\/em> remove him from the game.  You don't even need the Hedge Fund so much, so just hold them to recover from Siphon.<\/p>\n\n<p>The trickiest part of this is that you actually WANT to discard some of the cards (Shipment from SanSan priarily, others conditionally).  To do this, you want to be careful about keeping hand and credits about the same.<\/p>\n\n<p>ICE selection is just meant to be a spread, and cheap to rez.  They don't really stop for long, just slow down hopefully.  Pick whatever you like, but keep it cheap.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Combo up:<\/strong> \nNow solve the puzzle.  When can you win outright from your hand?  You'll need  minimum of 8 cards in many combinations.  The only card you absolutely need is Power Shutdown, and it sure helps to have Jackson Howard and Accelerated Diagnostics.  The next thing you're looking for is one of each agenda.  You can make it work with as little as one, but its trickier.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>First an example:<\/em><\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/netrunnerdb.com\/en\/card\/04058\">Power Shutdown<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/netrunnerdb.com\/en\/card\/01059\">Biotic Labor<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Install <a href=\"http:\/\/netrunnerdb.com\/en\/card\/04015\">Jackson Howard<\/a> (burn him to seed the Accelerated Diagnostics)<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/netrunnerdb.com\/en\/card\/04052\">Accelerated Diagnostics<\/a> - Shipment from MirrorMorph (1 of each agenda), Shipment from SanSan x2 (Score Efficiency Committee +3 clicks)<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/netrunnerdb.com\/en\/card\/01058\">Archived Memories<\/a>  (Jackson Howard) <\/li>\n<li>Install <a href=\"http:\/\/netrunnerdb.com\/en\/card\/04015\">Jackson Howard<\/a> (burn to seed Accelerated Diagnostics)<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/netrunnerdb.com\/en\/card\/04052\">Accelerated Diagnostics<\/a> - Shipment from SanSan x3<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/netrunnerdb.com\/en\/card\/01100\">Shipment from Kaguya<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p><strong>Count 'em:<\/strong>  10 cards from hand, 8 credits.<\/p>\n\n<p>If you are scoring through an Efficiency Committee you need to fire off 6 of the advancing shipments, with at least 1 being a Shipment from Kaguya.  This gets you 12 advancment tokens to spread on 3 agendas.  The reason one needs to be a Shipment from Kaguya is because you need to finish off the odd numbered agendas.<\/p>\n\n<p>There are <em>MANY<\/em> ways to win--the challenge is in figuring out the puzzle.  Total number of clicks is <strong>15<\/strong>:  12 (advances), 3 (installs).  So the puzzle is in getting those extra 12 clicks to get up to 15, and there are many ways.  Primarily, the Accelerated Diagnostics gains +5 clicks if you use it with 3 <em>double<\/em> cards.  However, it cost a click for Power shutdown, and a click to install Jackson Howard so the first Accelerated Diagnostics will <em>net<\/em> you at most +3 clicks.  Being as Power Shutdown only needs to fire once, the 2nd Accelerated Diagnostics can gain you 4 more.  Shipment from Mirrormorph gains you 2 clicks, Efficiency Committee gains 3 more, and Shipment from Kaguya gains 1 click.<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/netrunnerdb.com\/en\/card\/04052\">Accelerated Diagnostics<\/a> x2 (7 clicks)<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/netrunnerdb.com\/en\/card\/03005\">Efficiency Committee<\/a> (3 clicks)<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/netrunnerdb.com\/en\/card\/01060\">Shipment from MirrorMorph<\/a> (2 clicks)<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/netrunnerdb.com\/en\/card\/01100\">Shipment from Kaguya<\/a> (1 click)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p><em>Total:<\/em>  16  (adding the 3 normal clicks)<\/p>\n\n<p>Easy right?  There is even a spare click there to Archived Memories up something we need.  Well -- not so easy.  2 reasons:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>You do not always have all the cards you need, and so you have to make concessions from the optimal path, which is using all Shipment from SanSan with your Accelerated Diagnostics.<\/li>\n<li><em>When<\/em> the clicks are used is extremely important.  You don't get an advance up-front on them all, and you have to generate as you go.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>Once you have the base math in your head, you can begin to recognize when its go-time.  If you don't have a card you need in hand, then add a click to sub a wild card (Archived Memories).  Compensate with Biotic Labor for each of these needed.  If you have a 2nd Vitrivius in place of an Efficiency Committee you can either A.  add a click (i.e. one less advance needed), or B. add a click (over-advance and one less Archived Memories to play).   Not using Efficiency Committee then only loses you 2 clicks, which can be purchased for 8 credits with Biotic Labor x2.<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>+1 click if your opponent leaves a Jackson Howard on the table for you.<\/li>\n<li>+4 clicks if you go through a 3rd Accelerated Diagnostics.  Although typically you only do this in trickier combos.<\/li>\n<li>-1 clicks when you play a non-double with Accelerated Diagnostics.<\/li>\n<li>-1 click to \"find\" a card in archives with Archived Memories or Interns.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p><strong>Scenario:<\/strong> \nIn your hand is a <a href=\"http:\/\/netrunnerdb.com\/en\/card\/04058\">Power Shutdown<\/a>, Jackson Howard, Accelerated Diagnostics x2, 1 of each agenda, and Archived Memories x2.  Doing the base math that is +7 for the 2 Accelerated Diagnostics and +3 for the Efficiency Committee.  If we burn one of our Archived Memories for a third Accelerated Diagnostics then we'll get another +3.  Total of 13, so it looks good.  Its at least worth thinking about now, but the first hurdle is making sure you can score your Efficiency Committee with a click to spare to harvest the clicks.  It would go something like this:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/netrunnerdb.com\/en\/card\/04058\">Power Shutdown<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Install <a href=\"http:\/\/netrunnerdb.com\/en\/card\/04015\">Jackson Howard<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Pausing here for a moment.  We need a Shipment from MirrorMorph to save clicks before we can get the Efficiency Committee scored so we're going to need to use 1 of the Accelerated Diagnostics slots on Shipment from MirrorMorph to install the Efficiency Committee.  If we were to Shipment from SanSan x2 for the next 2 Accelerated Diagnostics slots to score an Efficiency Committee then we don't have a click left to harvest our Efficiency Committee clicks.  So we're going to need to aim at our 2nd Accelerated Diagnostics to score the Efficiency Committee.  We'll need to gain a couple more clicks with Biotic to get there, so add that to the Accelerated Diagnostics mix.  Finally, we need to get another Jackson Howard out anyway, so lets use the last Accelerated Diagnostics slot for an Interns.  We will fit in Shipment from SanSan x5 into the next 2 Accelerated Diagnostics, but first lets get that Efficiency Committee scored.<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/netrunnerdb.com\/en\/card\/04052\">Accelerated Diagnostics<\/a> - Shipment from MirrorMorph (3 Agendas), Interns (Jackson Howard), Biotic Labor<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Next click we'll use the Accelerated Diagnostics to score the Efficiency Committee, and Interns for Jackson Howard to setup for the 3rd Accelerated Diagnostics that is not yet in hand.<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/netrunnerdb.com\/en\/card\/04052\">Accelerated Diagnostics<\/a> - Shipment from SanSan x2, Interns (Jackson Howard) (Score Efficiency Committee)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Whew, click relief now with that Efficiency Committee, we're well on our way.  Utilize those 2 wild cards (Archives Memories) to dig a Shipment from Kaguya and an Accelerated Diagnostics from archives and finish it off.<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/netrunnerdb.com\/en\/card\/01058\">Archived Memories<\/a> - Accelerated Diagnostics<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/netrunnerdb.com\/en\/card\/01058\">Archived Memories<\/a> - Shipment from Kaguya<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/netrunnerdb.com\/en\/card\/04052\">Accelerated Diagnostics<\/a> - Shipment from SanSan x3<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/netrunnerdb.com\/en\/card\/01100\">Shipment from Kaguya<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Checking our math, 8 full clicks used.  +3 for Efficiency Committee, +2 for Biotic, +3 starting.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Count 'em:<\/strong> 9 cards from hand, 9 credits used.<\/p>\n\n<p>This is just one scenario, and its more complicated than you know to figure it out in the middle of a game where your opponent is not going to let you take 10 minutes to puzzle it out.  It can work with only 2 agendas in hand.  It can work with zero Jackson Howards in hand (or table).  It can work without using Efficiency Committee.  You just need to solve the puzzle :)<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Looking Ahead:<\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Quandry in place of NEXT Bronze to save a credit.  <\/li>\n<li>No Panic Button on purpose.  Not because of money, but because it takes a click to install and also its a trashable card for the runner to help dig R&amp;D.  <\/li>\n<li>Reclamation Orders on first glance seems good, but there are surprisingly few combos that would benefit from it.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>The primary thing here is that the deck draws so darned fast, that it does not actually take you that long to setup.

It's primary mode of winning is by points with Scorch as more of a secondary option if possible. GRNDL is new enough to instill fear into those who haven't taken the time to research and play test this ID for themselves and the negative of bad pub can be cleared with the help of Double Time's Witness Tampering. Rez Archer and Grim in front of initial ICE to surprise runners and trash their programs along with Power Shutdown to get rid of those pesky SMCs, Datasucker, Parasite, Corroder, etc. If you find yourself in a sticky situation and need to resort to Scorching there are three ways to tag with this deck: Snare, SEA Source, and Posted Bounty. Project Atlas is the star in the deck when over scored early game which enables you to grab that missing Scorch component at crucial moments which catch the runner off guard. <\/p>\n","username":"skaterforsale","cards":{"01070":3,"01086":1,"01094":3,"01095":1,"01098":3,"01099":3,"01101":2,"01103":2,"01110":3,"01111":3,"01113":2,"02018":3,"02060":3,"04015":2,"04017":2,"04020":3,"04036":2,"04040":2,"04058":2,"04097":1,"04117":2,"04118":2}},{"id":3806,"name":"ANDROMEDA (4th at Comix City too!

I decided to add an HQ Interface to help against Fast Advance and the up and coming but very powerful Cerebral Imaging decks. I have to say the addition of Mr. Li and a third copy of Desperado really made the difference with this versus previous versions I play tested. Installing Desperado from your opening hand can make the difference between pinching credits and rolling in the money and Mr. Li helps tremendously for card pull when Pro Contacts is trashed or just too expensive. Best part is the cards you put at the bottom of your stack with Li can be resurfaced with a Special Order or two when looking for breakers to install. All in all Andromeda has been and still is a front runner (no pun intended) against just about every corp that stands in her way!<\/p>\n","username":"skaterforsale","cards":{"01007":2,"01008":3,"01011":1,"01014":1,"01018":3,"01019":3,"01021":3,"01022":3,"01024":3,"01026":1,"01032":2,"01049":2,"01050":3,"01051":1,"02009":2,"02083":1,"02085":1,"02091":1,"02104":2,"02105":1,"02107":2,"03049":1,"03052":2,"04004":2}},{"id":3807,"name":"Ken like Pikenchu","creation":"2014-04-02 22:27:01","description":"\n","username":"Pikenchu","cards":{"01004":1,"01018":3,"01021":3,"01022":2,"01028":1,"01036":1,"01050":3,"02009":2,"02085":1,"02091":1,"02106":1,"02107":1,"03035":1,"03049":1,"03052":3,"03054":3,"04004":2,"04044":1,"04046":2,"04048":1,"04063":1,"05029":1,"05032":3,"05037":3,"05041":1,"05042":1,"05046":1,"05050":1}},{"id":3808,"name":"Ken like Pikenchu 4.2.14","creation":"2014-04-02 22:32:58","description":"\n","username":"Pikenchu","cards":{"01004":1,"01018":3,"01021":3,"01022":2,"01028":1,"01036":1,"01050":3,"02009":2,"02085":1,"02091":1,"02106":1,"02107":1,"03035":1,"03049":1,"03052":3,"03054":3,"04004":2,"04046":2,"04048":1,"04063":1,"05029":1,"05032":3,"05035":1,"05037":3,"05041":1,"05042":1,"05046":1,"05050":1}},{"id":3809,"name":"False Patriarchy","creation":"2014-04-02 22:34:16","description":"<p><em>What?

The modifications generally revolve around Blue Sun's ability to pick up rezed cards for cash, and therefor I've included some larger Barriers as well as <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02079\">Oversight AI<\/a>, in order to utilize them as a cash influx.  The <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02079\">Oversight AI<\/a> can also be used to rez an Archer in a pinch, if you either don't want to sacrifice an agenda or want to be able to rez it but don't anticipate having the spare cash to do so (rare, but occasionally possible).<\/p>\n\n<p>I have included a couple traps in the form of <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01057\">Aggressive Secretary<\/a> and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01069\">Project Junebug<\/a> in order to goad the runner into making a mistake by running on them.  I chose advanceable traps in order to make them seem more convincing.  Generally, the only agendas you don't want to advance as soon as you lay them down are the two copies of <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02080\">False Lead<\/a>, and if they're both scored then it's hard to make a trap look like an agenda if you can't advance it.  Plus, if the runner doesn't take the bait, then you can suck the trap back to your hand next turn.  Sure, it wastes the money spent advancing it, as well as gives away what possible future traps might be, but it also makes the runner very, very wary about running on future advanced agendas, knowing that they very well may be the trap again.<\/p>\n\n<p>I'm on the fence about <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04117\">Hive<\/a>, because it is amazing early game, as it presents a very hard barrier to crack, and can be very expensive to get through for it's cost.  However, in the late game the card can be literally blank.  The upside to this is that you can always suck it back up and regain five credits, but then it's just fodder for tossing into archives, and any future Hives you draw are similarly useless.  If I replaced it, I might just use an Ice Wall.  It is also fairly useless in the late game, but can at least be advanced to become more formidable if necessary, and costs 4 credits less.<\/p>\n\n<p>Previously instead of the advanceable traps, I was playing two copies of <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04037\">Elizabeth Mills<\/a> in order to negate all the Bad Publicity that this deck can generate, using Blue Sun to take a Bad Pub away each turn.  While this was nice, it's fairly slow in practice, and doesn't feel aggressive enough for what Supermodernism generally tries to accomplish.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Anyhow, let me know if you can think of any improvements!  I'm sure there are a lot of ways for this deck to be built with this ID, and I'd love to hear your take on it!<\/p>\n","username":"Saan","cards":{"01057":1,"01069":1,"01070":2,"01083":2,"01086":2,"01090":1,"01094":3,"01099":3,"01101":3,"01102":2,"01110":3,"01111":3,"01113":1,"02018":3,"02060":1,"02079":3,"02080":2,"03027":1,"04017":3,"04020":1,"04036":1,"04040":2,"04078":1,"04100":2,"04117":2,"06068":1}},{"id":10008,"name":"Urban Warfare","creation":"2014-10-21 05:12:46","description":"<p>A fairly standard Reina rushdown deck using a mix of Anarch pressure tools and Caissa to force an attack.  The idea is to ramp up gradually from Knight\/Parasite to a Darwin\/Cyberfeeder\/Bishop\/e3FI late-game rig that can keep pressuring the opponent.<\/p>\n\n<p>Darwin here is a replacement for Overmind from previous versions of the deck.  Darwin gets the nod now because this deck is less focused on forcing telegraphed multi-access runs and instead is happy to poke around the weak spots of the corporation's servers with Hemorrhage rewarding otherwise-fruitless runs of opportunity.<\/p>\n\n<p>In terms of program choice, the Caissa suite is great for Rook's obvious synergy with Reina's ID, but also for some more subtle reasons.  By running more Caissa (rather then more Viruses) you keep the corps' Virus Purge DEFCON low and also incentivize the corp trashing their own ICE, which this deck loves.  Bishop gets little love normally but in this deck it provides a surprise factor that Datasucker lacks (it's like getting a free Surge on the turn you install a Sucker) while also playing into the previously-mentioned strengths.<\/p>\n\n<p>Hemorrhage is the 'win condition' program of choice because it fits into Reina's opportunistic attack strategy.  An early Hemorrhage provides immense pressure on the corp, usually the first things to fall out of HQ are ICE and utility cards followed by Econ events.  Every card bled out of HQ in this way makes it harder and harder to replace ICE lost to Parasite and the Caissa suite.<\/p>\n","username":"umbralAeronaut","cards":{"01002":1,"01005":3,"01010":2,"01012":2,"01018":1,"01053":2,"02003":3,"02009":1,"02024":2,"02082":2,"02102":2,"03052":3,"04002":2,"04003":3,"04005":1,"04021":2,"04041":1,"04042":2,"04043":3,"04082":3,"04109":3,"06073":3}},{"id":10009,"name":"Val's Andy","creation":"2014-10-21 06:04:00","description":"<p>Just trying to make the most consistent Andy possible.<\/p>\n","username":"valbaca","cards":{"01007":2,"01008":3,"01018":3,"01020":2,"01021":3,"01022":3,"01024":3,"01026":1,"01030":2,"01043":1,"01050":3,"01051":1,"02063":1,"02083":1,"02091":2,"02104":3,"02105":1,"02107":2,"03052":3,"03053":3,"04004":1,"05035":2}},{"id":10010,"name":"Murderface","creation":"2014-10-21 07:33:17","description":"<p>This deck has one thing in mind, Murder.

Move faster.<\/p>\n\n<p>This hardware-centric Kit build gets set up fast with Replicator, Inside Man, and Astrolabe. The newest Shaper console works wonders here. The more the corp tries to expand their server portfolio, the quicker you can get yourself set up, and that additional 1 MU will make a world of difference in the amount of pressure you can put on. Now you can have a Magnum Opus, a breaker, and an SMC in play without having to have dropped up to 4 credits on your first CyberSolutions.<\/p>\n\n<p>The biggest change here is the one-off Imp. To free up the influence, I dropped the Datasucker\/Parasite combo after a lot of back-and-forth. I originally ran them both for a number of reasons (DS to lighten some of the load for my recurring stealth creds against the heaviest of glaciers, and Parasite to nuke one-iced centrals in RP that would essentially negate Kit's ability), but in nearly 50 plays with this build, I can't say I've consistently been happy to draw into either card. Using them, when they do pop up, is almost never the best option as I've found that the problems they solve can be worked around with the number of stealth options this deck packs: between Ghost Runner, Lockpicks, Cloaks, and Kit's ability, hurting for stealth credits is rare. Taking a closer look then, Imp makes much more sense. You will almost always end up with early multi-access capability, and that means you can start digging to kill off combo pieces. Be smart about what you Imp. You can always overwrite it and clone chip it back, but make sure you're controlling the corp's game plan a little more efficiently than just sniping a Hedge Fund when you know your opponent could be holding a Biotic or a SanSan.<\/p>\n\n<p>This build isn't wildly different from the first version that inspired it. The second copy of Magnum Opus has been dropped, which can put a little more weight on your Clone Chips' shoulders in the rare event it gets trashed (run smart!), but since I always SMC out the Mopus, inevitably drawing into the second was a big disappointment. As with before, you'll want Mopus ASAP because it's your Scorch\/Midseasons protection in a deck that just doesn't have time for Plascrete. Don't be afraid to click an entire for 8 credits whenever you feel comfortable: your win rate with this deck will skyrocket when you can start to identify economy windows.

This deck will be updated once the Lunar cycle is completed.<\/p>\n\n<p>Most attempts at getting <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02010\">Haas-Bioroid: Stronger Together<\/a> to work are glacier decks, something which the big bioroids are particularly good at. This deck tries to go in the opposite direction, spreading out its many assets and upgrades over a lot of remotes. You will feel underpowered and overwhelmed at the start of every game (unless your facing an extremely deliberate runner), but if you survive, you might feel like King Midas later on.<\/p>\n\n<p>A lot of your remotes will go unprotected, which necessitates high trash costs, and your centrals will be porous during the early game, so you will have to risk a couple of stolen agenda points at the start. The ice composition is intended to stem those early bleeds as much as possible: <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02110\">Eli 1.0<\/a> and the small <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01063\">Viktor 1.0<\/a> are the workhorses for this, with a <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02052\">Viper<\/a> and a <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04120\">Quandary<\/a> thrown in to spice things up a bit.

Be the straw that breaks the camel\u2018s back is the motto of this deck. Ideally, you\u2019ll play the Protocols along with an <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02092\">Eve Campaign<\/a> or a <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01109\">PAD Campaign<\/a>, and possibly you can even afford to protect them.<\/p>\n\n<p>Apart from being a useful money injection in a deck that mostly relies on drip economy (but those drips can add up ...), the <a href=\"\/en\/card\/05026\">Diversified Portfolio<\/a> is a nice cover move if you intend to sneak out a 3\/2 agenda between all those assets \u2013 slap two new remotes on the table, follow through with the Portfolio, and few runners will go and investigate whether it\u2019s just another PAD they can\u2019t afford to trash.<\/p>\n\n<p>As nice as it may play against Shapers and Criminals (Eve and Howler make for nice Siphon denial), Anarchs are bad news and Whizzard is an obvious nemesis. Quetzal might also become one, less for her innate ability, but for the apparently inevitable inclusion of E3 in her decks.<\/p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, the update to the Lunar cycle might bring a considerable boost, and I\u2019m very much tempted to go to 54 cards, at least for the testing stages.

New to the game so any advice would be appreciated.<\/p>\n","username":"accelerandom","cards":{"01001":1,"01002":3,"01004":3,"01005":3,"01006":2,"01008":3,"01009":3,"01010":1,"01012":3,"01015":2,"01016":2,"01047":2,"01049":1,"01050":3,"01051":2,"02041":1,"02049":2,"02050":3,"02081":2,"02087":2,"02091":2,"02102":1,"03054":1,"04005":1,"06014":1}},{"id":10021,"name":"Foundry Fast Advance 0.1","creation":"2014-10-21 18:52:37","description":"<p>Amazon up R&amp;D and\/or HQ, create a slightly taxing remote to put SanSan\/Jackson\/Adonis in, score via fast advance or early NAPDs\/bluffs.<\/p>\n\n<p>First draft.<\/p>\n","username":"ain","cards":{"01055":3,"01056":2,"01058":2,"01059":3,"01092":2,"01110":3,"02038":3,"02051":3,"02056":2,"02070":3,"02110":2,"03005":1,"04011":3,"04015":2,"04119":3,"05024":2,"06002":3,"06003":2,"06021":1,"06061":2,"06062":3}},{"id":10022,"name":"Time Is On My Side (Yes It Is) ","creation":"2014-10-21 20:06:37","description":"<p>Ok, Andy will probably be able to provide the pieces on the first hand.

With the rig done, one run with <a href=\"\/en\/card\/05048\">Security Testing<\/a> will give you 2 credits, a <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01008\">Datasucker<\/a> counter, a card from <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04009\">John Masanori<\/a> and a extra click from <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02064\">Doppelg\u00e4nger<\/a>. That's a lot for a single click! <\/p>\n\n<p>The extra clicks also make <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01044\">Magnum Opus<\/a> a lot more powerful, giving you 12 credits in a turn, if you're broken. And it allows you to put 5 counters on <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01051\">Crypsis<\/a> before running a remote.

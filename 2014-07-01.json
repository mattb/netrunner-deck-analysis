Looking at the base ability of HB Stronger Together, it would appear to be really good once you get the Bioroid Ice stacked and that truly is the case. Because you are not getting that one credit with installation, Economy at the start is a bit rough if you are used to ETF but once you get your economy up and running you will be laughing. The agendas are chosen to sustain your momentum. Corporate War, Priority Requisition ensure that when you are finished advancing your agendas you don't lose any tempo. Efficiency Committee was initially a Project Vitruvius, which I would over score, I switched to EC because of the synergy it has with MMC. Inazuma works so well with Bioroid ice it is the only ice I have that has three copies (except for Eli of course;)). All of the operations and Assets are there to help you make money so economy should not be a problem. With ths amount of taxing this ice provides, scroring windows will appear and when they do you should be ready to install and advance your agendas. Hive is the only ice that I'm not sold on, Aggressive secretary could also be Ash.

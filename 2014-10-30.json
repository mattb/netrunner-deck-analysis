I've never built a Criminal deck until now. Enter \"The Silver Bullet.\" It's built around one card (Unregistered S&amp;W '35) and the idea it inspired, and I've wanted to make it work since Honor &amp; Profit came out. It's my White Whale, and I want to go after it. So what's the grand scheme? How do I want to achieve ultimate self-realization in Netrunner? Simple.<\/p>\n\n<p>I want to win the game by shooting Jackson Howard.<\/p>\n\n<p>The plan is crazy. But is it crazy enough to work? Let's take a look. Your goal here is to Keyhole their R&amp;D into oblivion at all times. Keyhole when there's no Jackson in sight. Keyhole when Jackson is in sight. Keyhole is your friend, and you want to dump everything of value into archives.<\/p>\n\n<p>\"But wait,\" you say. \"If I dump everything of value into archives, and Jackson's on the table, the corp will just shuffle the good stuff back into R&amp;D.\" And you're right. They will. If you run archives.<\/p>\n\n<p>Keyhole? That was just step 1 in our plan. Now it's time for step 2. It's time to deal with the Howard, and an Unregistered S&amp;W '35 is the perfect tool for the job. But we need access to HQ, and if we've been spending our money getting into R&amp;D for our Keyhole runs, we might need a little help breaching our latest central server target. That's when you lay down the Feint. Most corps will double-ice HQ to shut down the Inside Job, and that's fine. We're not interested in what's their hand, so we don't need to access. Feint works beautifully, and hopefully by this point you've managed to get your Blackguard online. When you sneak into HQ, hopefully you can expose and force the Jackson rez, if he hasn't been rezzed already.<\/p>\n\n<p>Step 3. Install the gun. Spend two clicks to pull the trigger.<\/p>\n\n<p>Archives is now yours.<\/p>\n\n<hr \/>\n\n<p>Yes, I realize this can and very likely would work better and more efficiently with Hades Shard. But I'm not interested in that. I want to get my hands dirty. I want to strike fear into the corp's heart with an R&amp;D Keyhole lock, then slip my way into HQ and take out Jackson.

The idea of the deck is to quickly load up the corp with bad pub, then play your protesters and stack your hemorrhage.

I went pumpable breakers because you can't afford to get shut out and miss tokens on your hemorrhage. I think it would be easy to get the corp to 4 or 5 bad pub with this set up, especially if they are Weyland and scoring hostiles already. SOT for the blackmails\/Legwork as I would imagine agendas would end up in HQ, trash, or hastily thrown into a remote. Deja Vu is there to recur protesters or parasites. I would imagine Blue sun would be difficult for this deck as they can just OAI an ice to make blackmail more difficult which is even more reason to go with this breaker suite. Raymond Flint is there because if you get him out early while you are setting up giving bad pub you can snag an agenda out of HQ and for the expose for blackmail runs. Miss Tallie is there for scorched protection and giving bad pub. I feel like Inject was a good fit here since only 12\/45 cards are programs and I need to get through the deck fast to get the corp loaded up on bad pub.

Instead of going the route of the most obvious synergy and putting in #E3-Feedback Implants and AI-Breakers I decided to use the classic Anarch-Suite. <\/p>\n\n<p>Although this decklist is by no means final, it is quite good and i haven't missed E3's, yet. <\/p>\n\n<p>So why use Quetzal then, you might ask. Good question: I think Quetzals main strength is to build up pressure very fast, because at least one type of ice is pretty weak in the early game. Quetzals Ability does three things for me: \n1. I can run early and can pressure the corp, so they need to rezz Ice asap and in a best case scenario for them it is not a barrier or at least one with more than one subroutine\n2. facechecking Wall of Thornes or Heimdalls and so on wont hurt me, but is quite expensive for the corpr\u00b4 to rezz\n3. having a mimic &amp; or yog.0 early is in most cases all i need to run effectively at least once every turn\nFurthermore Quetzals ability is like a recurring credit for breaking barriers, so even if start breaking ice with corroder i save one credit each turn, which is quite ok, considering the enormous pressure for the corp which goes alongside with her ability.<\/p>\n\n<p>To make things even more effective i've included two personal touches (mainly for yog.0 as a target). So i can get easily through Lotus field, even if the corp purged last turn and i have no token on my datasucker anymore. Imp and demo-run + nerve agent\/medium help me sniping keycards of the corp and pressure both HQ and RnD. (which is quite important, as there are no plascretes in here)<\/p>\n\n<p>I haven't played the deck too much, yet, but have won most games (against CI, EtF, PE and Blue Sun) and lost one against NEH (very close one) - so it doesn't seem too bad :)<\/p>\n\n<p>I an earlier iteration i even used black cat and refractor, but i had the feeling, that the setup time for those is quite slow as i need to get all those little stealth key pieces into play.<\/p>\n","username":"Oneiro","cards":{"01002":3,"01003":1,"01005":2,"01006":2,"01007":2,"01008":3,"01010":2,"01011":3,"01012":3,"01014":3,"01019":1,"01034":2,"01040":2,"01050":3,"02003":3,"02041":2,"02091":2,"04109":3,"06052":1,"06073":3}},{"id":10357,"name":"Event Overload V35.2","creation":"2014-10-30 17:34:58","description":"\n","username":"ThisIsAzrael","cards":{"01034":3,"01035":1,"01036":3,"01037":1,"01042":1,"01049":1,"01050":3,"02046":1,"02047":3,"02087":1,"02106":2,"03031":1,"03035":2,"03052":3,"04004":1,"04027":2,"04047":1,"04065":1,"04107":3,"04109":3,"05035":1,"05054":2,"06038":1}},{"id":10358,"name":"Noise Got Buds","creation":"2014-10-30 20:22:01","description":"<p>Removing dead draws from Noise with typical 3x Pawnshop and 3x Wyldside builds and replacing with a connection tutor utility package.<\/p>\n","username":"mmychal","cards":{"01001":1,"01002":3,"01005":3,"01006":2,"01008":3,"01010":1,"01012":3,"01047":1,"01051":3,"02003":3,"02009":2,"02041":1,"02063":1,"02091":1,"03035":1,"03049":1,"03054":3,"04004":2,"04022":2,"04043":1,"06034":1,"06037":3,"06059":1,"06073":3}},{"id":10359,"name":"JSupermodernism 1.2","creation":"2014-10-30 21:08:55","description":"<p>A few words about the the key decisions:<\/p>\n\n<h1>Philosophy<\/h1>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Medtech ability encourages faster gameplay and this deck tries to take advantage of that (Early advance - not to confuse with Fast Advance)<\/li>\n<li>You have some limited possibility to do Fast Advance with Sansan<\/li>\n<li>Faster gameplay can force runner to run prematurely and you can take try to take advantage of that<\/li>\n<li>It can be piloted somehow like Supermodernism deck (but some key factors are missing I'll explain later)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<h1>Agendas (<strong>2 pointers are better than 3 pointers<\/strong>)<\/h1>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Less randomness (first turn R&amp;D access etc)<\/li>\n<li>Easier to score<\/li>\n<li>Can be scored out of hand with SanSan or even without (Medical)<\/li>\n<li>Apart from 2\/3s we can use the best neutral 2 pointer => NAPD<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<h1>Economy<\/h1>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Supermodernism fuels economy with scoring agendas - here we don't have this luxury<\/li>\n<li>With 3 main options for economy (asset\/event\/clicking) I've chosen events (like supermodernism)<\/li>\n<li>Asset economy suggests longer game and you need fast burst of economy for early advance<\/li>\n<li>Without economy agendas you're much more reliable on drawing proper events at the right time<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<h1>ICE<\/h1>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Usually it's better to install only the cheap ones (as you lack strong economy)<\/li>\n<li>Komainus are a fallback if the early phase has passed and there is a need for taxing the runner. I do not install komainu against parasite decks since they're waste of money. The only exception is to rez them only for a neural EMP kill move next turn.<\/li>\n<li>Roto is good against criminals who are forced to run early against your early scoring - when the're running with single breaker without fearie.

Knight, Femme Fatale and Atman, can all benefit greatly from Scavenge. Same Old Thing is basically there just for Scavenge.<\/p>\n\n<p>I picked Deep Red simply but because it allows to use Knight way more efficiently, and the extra 3 MU will fully cover all the C\u00e4issa. Since I picked Magnum Opus as the main economy engine, though, I added a couple Akamatsu to allow some flexibility.<\/p>\n\n<p>There is no R&amp;D attack because of the Woman in the Red Dress, which would work against it. Instead, I prefer to go for HQ, which is rather unusual and less expected out of Shapers. Raymond Flint goes along this line of thought, especially since it can provide extra access during the Corp's turn... and a couple HQ Interfaces might help.\nNaturally, it might get risky against Jinteki, but nobody forces you into using Raymond Flint against them, after all. Especially since the access is mandatory. Or I might just add some Net Damage protection in the next version if I notice it would help a lot.<\/p>\n","username":"paddosan","cards":{"01026":3,"01033":1,"01038":2,"01044":2,"01050":3,"02009":2,"02047":3,"02085":2,"03034":3,"03038":3,"03040":3,"03049":2,"03052":3,"03053":3,"03054":2,"04042":2,"04043":3,"04048":2,"04049":2}},{"id":1080,"name":"Rielle's Headlock v1.3","creation":"2013-12-23 07:06:26","description":"<p>Switched the economy balance to a quicker 3 Armitage Codebusting-2 Kati Jones; I will eventually get the same result, and the 3 Katies were just a need from back when I just had her and the Sure Gambles.

With bishop you're covered for ice 0-3 if you position your bishops correctly.  With femme out, you most likely don't need an atman at 0, so 1 and 2 is good also.  Then you're free to move your knights to support the atman\/bishop pair.

If this has been done before, I apologize for not giving credit where credit is due.  The idea here is to win from your hand with a multiple variations of a 7-10 card combo, and between 4 and 8 credits.<\/p>\n\n<p>First up, I want to highlight what <a href=\"http:\/\/netrunnerdb.com\/en\/profile\/1159\/PeekaySK\">PeekaySK<\/a> has pointed out already in the excellent writeup in his <a href=\"http:\/\/netrunnerdb.com\/en\/decklist\/3381\/cerebral-giraffes-vienna-store-champs-first-place-\">Cerebral Giraffes<\/a> deck--that is that Blue Level Clearance ramps up the CI identity greatly.<\/p>\n\n<p>Its pretty basic on strategy, massive draw potential, and the X-level clearances help keep your credit pool about where it needs to be.  You're driving at a core set of cards in hand:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/netrunnerdb.com\/en\/card\/04058\">Power Shutdown<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/netrunnerdb.com\/en\/card\/04052\">Accelerated Diagnostics<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/netrunnerdb.com\/en\/card\/04015\">Jackson<\/a><\/li>\n<li>3 Agendas (one being a 5\/3)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Supplemented to this, although not explicitly required is:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/netrunnerdb.com\/en\/card\/01059\">Biotic Labor<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/netrunnerdb.com\/en\/card\/01058\">Archived Memories<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/netrunnerdb.com\/en\/card\/01100\">Shipment from Kaguya<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>There are so many win combinations, is it mind boggling, however I find it best to puzzle solve based on where the Jacksons are.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Backing up:<\/strong>  You want to draw -- draw as much as you can.  Use the X-level clearances, the Anonymous Tips, and even your 2nd Jackson in hand.  You don't even need the Hedge Fund so much unless you want to fuel a Panic Button with it for even more draw capability -- or to recover from the Siphon.<\/p>\n\n<p>The trickiest part of this is that you actually WANT to discard a set of the cards (Interns, Shipment from SanSan, Shipment from Mirrormorph).  To do this, you want to be careful about keeping hand and credits about the same.  Panic Button helps with this for sure.<\/p>\n\n<p>I did something controversial here.  I actually removed some ICE and dropped down to 46 cards.  It lives dangerous for certain, but in testing I found that installing ICE and rezzing it slows me down.  At the same time, I don't want to give absolutely free Medium runs, and\/or HQ runs.  3 seems freakishly small, but I threw a spread of some low cost stoppers just to trip them up a bit.   I did this for throughput -- although feel free to add 3 more of your favorite ICE if you wish.  I don't think its critical either way.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Combo up:<\/strong> Now solve the puzzle.  Start with the basic win condition if they for some reason left a Jackson down on the table.  Wait for a run, then:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Power Shutdown (deck)<\/li>\n<li>Accelerated Diagnostics - Shipment from Mirrormorph (Agenda x3)\nShipment from SanSan x2 (score Efficiency Committe, gain 3 clicks)<\/li>\n<li>Install Jack<\/li>\n<li>Accerated Diagnostics - Shipment from SanSan x3<\/li>\n<li>Shipment from Kaguya (FTW)<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>Because this actually has an extra click, you can then be missing either a Jackson, Shipment from Kaguya, or Accelerated Diagnostics and sub in the Archived Memories to use that extra click to fetch what you need.  This makes the core combo extremely versatile.\n<strong>Count em:<\/strong>  8 cards from hand (one can be a wild card), and 4 credits<\/p>\n\n<p>I never count on a bare Jackson surviving, and the deck would be very weak if it needed it, so this next variation is really what you want.  On that note, don't put down a Jackson onto the table unless you have a 2nd in hand or an AM to spare to get it back.<\/p>\n\n<p>You need to score your Efficiency Committee with a click to spare, so enter Biotic Labor, and execute the same combo with Jackson from hand. \n<strong>Count em:<\/strong>  10 cards from hand (one can be a wild card), and 8 credits<\/p>\n\n<p>Suppose you're running tight and need to use 2 wild cards (Archived Memories), and you only have a single Jackson in hand.  You then do something a bit more creative:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Biotic Labor<\/li>\n<li>Install Jackson<\/li>\n<li>Power Shutdown<\/li>\n<li>Accelerated Diagnostics - Interns (Jackson), Shipment from Mirrormorph (Agenda x3), Subliminal Messaging (gain a click).<\/li>\n<li>Accelerated Diagnostics - Interns (Jackson), Shipment from SanSan x2 (Score EC, gain 3 clicks)<\/li>\n<li>Accelerated Diagnostics - Shipment from SanSan x3<\/li>\n<li>Shipment from Kaguya (FTW)<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>This spares you 2 extra clicks to go fill in the combo with your Archived Memories (AD, ShipK).\n<strong>Count em:<\/strong>  10 cards (2 wild), 8 credits<\/p>\n\n<p>Finally, if you have 3 wild cards in hand and a bit more cash, you do the same as above but use a Biotic Labor in place of the Subliminal Messaging, this gives you use of the 3rd wild card at the expense of 5 more credits.\n<strong>Count em:<\/strong>  10 cards (3 wild), 13 credits<\/p>\n\n<p>There are more ways to win as well--the challenge is in figuring out the puzzle.  For instance, ShipM, a couple of Jacks, a couple AD's and a Biotic in hand, BUT you're missing the EC and instead have a 2nd Vitruvius.  You have a win condition if you work it out.<\/p>\n\n<p>You can use your 2nd Power Shutdown to kill off something annoying (Medium).  Do so only if you have Archived Memories to recover critical other cards, and really these are clicks taken away from drawing, so not ideal.<\/p>\n\n<p>Similar on the edge move; play an AD blind.  You have a ton of operations and if you can recover the AD then why not?<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Looking Ahead:<\/strong>  I would add a single Reclamation Order in place of the Panic Button probably.  This just gives more options since it could be added to the first AD set in order to grab a couple missing AD's.  I'm not even sure I like the Panic Button anyway because it always angers me when they can dig out another card from R&amp;D.  Quandry is another good option to reduce the rez cost burden for an EtR.<\/p>\n\n<p>The primary thing here is that the deck draws so darned fast, that it does not actually take you that long to setup.  The primary hurt is the Anarch suite:  Medium, Nerve Agent, Imp, and Vamp.<\/p>\n\n<p>This is not as competitive as <a href=\"http:\/\/netrunnerdb.com\/en\/profile\/1159\/PeekaySK\">PeeKaySK's<\/a> version, but it sure it fun to potentially be at a winning state from nothing in any given turn after the 4th or 5th (usually 10 or 11).<\/p>\n","username":"vreely","cards":{"01058":3,"01059":2,"01060":1,"01064":1,"01083":3,"01100":2,"01110":3,"01113":1,"02039":3,"02051":3,"02052":1,"02070":3,"03001":1,"03005":3,"04015":3,"04034":3,"04052":3,"04058":2,"04060":1,"04072":1,"04090":3,"04100":1}},{"id":3464,"name":"Reina Ice Melter","creation":"2014-03-25 11:28:19","description":"<p>Concept Reina deck.  nothing new here.<\/p>\n","username":"liquidcooled","cards":{"01002":3,"01006":3,"01007":2,"01008":2,"01009":3,"01012":3,"01020":3,"01049":3,"01050":3,"01051":2,"01053":2,"02022":3,"02024":2,"02041":1,"02081":3,"02090":3,"02091":2,"04041":1,"04043":3,"04061":3}},{"id":3465,"name":"Reina Ice Melter","creation":"2014-03-25 11:55:22","description":"<p>Concept Reina deck.  nothing new here.<\/p>\n","username":"liquidcooled","cards":{"01002":3,"01006":3,"01007":2,"01008":2,"01009":3,"01012":3,"01015":2,"01020":3,"01049":2,"01050":3,"01051":2,"01053":2,"02022":3,"02041":1,"02081":2,"02087":2,"02090":3,"02091":2,"04041":1,"04043":3,"04061":3}},{"id":3466,"name":"Reina Ice Melter","creation":"2014-03-25 12:06:38","description":"<p>Concept Reina deck.  nothing new here.<\/p>\n","username":"liquidcooled","cards":{"01002":3,"01006":3,"01007":2,"01008":2,"01009":3,"01012":3,"01015":2,"01018":2,"01020":2,"01049":2,"01050":3,"01051":2,"01053":2,"02022":3,"02041":1,"02081":2,"02087":2,"02091":2,"02109":2,"04041":1,"04043":3,"04061":3}},{"id":3467,"name":"Raptor Run v3.5","creation":"2014-03-25 14:03:51","description":"<p>Design to rifle through your deck quickly to get your Rig out.

While trialling it, someone on OCTGN described my playstyle as 'like an Anarch on crack', which I'm pretty happy with even if I did totally lose that match, haha.<\/p>\n\n<p>Basically, the plan is to get Darwin up and Surged ASAP then start facechecking hard. Crypsis is for cheap ice, Darwin for expensive, Surge is to get them back into the game when the corp inevitably virus clears. Mimic and Inti are in there as a result of early tests - without them, this deck can be very weak against Swordsman and Wraparound. Pull them out with Special Order as necessary.<\/p>\n\n<p>I'm a big fan of heavy HQ pressure, because too many corps try to hide stuff in there. This deck is pretty disinterested in remotes except for when strictly necessary. I love deploying sneakdoor on the first click of a turn when they have a full HQ and then running three times in a row - it's a ridiculous play, but it sometimes pays off and it definitely keeps them on their toes.<\/p>\n\n<p>Dirty Laundry, Siphon and Sure Gamble are your primary economy, with daily casts as a backup for longer games - hence Networking and Lawyer Up to get rid of tags to keep those casts going. The one Blackmail is pretty much just a surprise card to screw with BP-happy corps who have made beautiful, elaborate, unrezzed ice towers which you haven't touched yet.<\/p>\n\n<p>I'm still fairly new to the game, but definitely looking for feedback, advice, and a wider audience for my terrible ideas and ridiculous playstyle. :)<\/p>\n","username":"bionicsheep","cards":{"01011":1,"01018":3,"01020":2,"01021":3,"01022":2,"01028":2,"01050":3,"01051":2,"02024":1,"02043":3,"02045":1,"02050":1,"02064":2,"02081":3,"02083":1,"02084":1,"02085":2,"02086":1,"02102":2,"02107":2,"03048":1,"03052":2,"03053":2,"03054":1,"04063":1,"04089":1}},{"id":3483,"name":"Jinteki Damage Deck","creation":"2014-03-25 22:38:55","description":"\n","username":"asmadai","cards":{"01067":1,"01069":2,"01070":3,"01071":2,"01072":2,"01073":1,"01074":1,"01075":2,"01076":3,"01078":2,"01084":1,"01088":1,"01099":2,"01106":1,"01107":2,"01109":3,"01110":3,"01113":2,"02014":2,"02019":2,"02032":3,"02033":2,"02039":1,"02112":1,"03023":3,"04073":3,"04092":2}},{"id":3484,"name":"GRNDL Venture","creation":"2014-03-25 23:00:41","description":"<p>Just experimenting with Bad Publicity based economy.

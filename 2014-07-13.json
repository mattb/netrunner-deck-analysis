I wanted to play something in NBN that wasn't Fast Advance and I believe that NBN has a number of tools that allow a glacier type build. <\/p>\n\n<p>Firstly it has Tollbooth, one of the best pieces of ICE in the game and extremely taxing and at home in a glacier build. Secondly it has an agenda that makes NBN glacier great, it has Project Beale, most other glacier decks need to run 3 pointers both for deck space and because it suits the play style. Beale allows us to win the game with only 3 agendas scored, while the runner will need four. One of the common cards in Red Coats was a one of Biotic Labor in case the runner locked down the remote in the late game, this allowed you to win via FA, this deck is going to have this simply because we are running Astroscript, however Astro has other uses such as making it easier to score a 3 point Beale.<\/p>\n\n<p>This deck is going to need a lot of economy, I'm certain that around 14 economy cards is the right call. I know that people will hate on Successful Demonstration but it is great early game when you need to rez a Tollbooth or other expensive ICE to keep the runner out, it ensures that you don't spend turns clicking for credits. I plan on testing Subliminal Messaging and Marked Accounts as well. I'm certain MMC is the right call as it forces the runner to run on the taxing remote or allow you to rez anything you want. It did work all day in the deck I won UK Nationals with, so its a keeper. <\/p>\n\n<p>ICE is still something I am testing, I tried Hive in an early version but found drawing it late game was irritating, so I dropped it. The bioroids work well as it is glacier, as does the Shinobi, if people run without a sentry breaker you tend to have a lot of money and so getting the flatline is achievable. I'm not certain on the Flare, Pop Ups and Wall of Statics, I am also considering an Inazuma at the cost of a Viper and something else. Draco works very well as it can be used early game cheaply or late game raised in strength so that it causes problems for Mimic, Femme etc. <\/p>\n\n<p>The two cards I am unsure of are the Red Herrings, I would prefer to run Ash, but what to drop? I believe that this may simply be a holding card until Midway Station Grid comes out which I feel would be ideal for a taxing deck, but obviously needs testing. One thing I was considering was putting in two Data Ravens and changing the Red Herrings for Closed Accounts.<\/p>\n\n<p>This is still very much in testing, however in the few games I have played with it has won a very high percentage of them. Part of this is an attitude runners have against NBN, they are desperate to stop the Astrotrain, this allows you to bait and tax them a lot. If runners struggle early to get breakers an early Astro or 3 point Beale is very strong. I like how versatile it is... <\/p>\n\n<p>Thoughts, feedback etc very much welcome :)<\/p>\n","username":"Cerberus","cards":{"01062":2,"01080":1,"01081":3,"01090":3,"01091":2,"01108":3,"01110":3,"01113":2,"02020":3,"02052":3,"02056":2,"02074":1,"02110":3,"02115":3,"03014":2,"04014":1,"04015":3,"04040":3,"04076":3,"04115":1,"04119":3}},{"id":7587,"name":"Shaper Tourney Deck","creation":"2014-07-13 12:11:58","description":"<p>http:\/\/stimhack.com\/winning-decklists-worcester-city-square-arcology-tournament-january-2014\/<\/p>\n","username":"Leviathan","cards":{"01008":3,"01012":3,"01014":1,"01036":3,"01038":3,"01041":2,"01045":1,"01050":3,"02049":3,"02106":3,"03028":1,"03031":1,"03038":3,"03040":3,"03045":1,"03046":3,"03049":3,"03052":3,"03053":3}},{"id":7588,"name":"Chasing the Story","creation":"2014-07-13 15:12:05","description":"<p>I'm impatient-- I get itchy sitting still and waiting for the runner to hit a perfectly placed ICE or trap.

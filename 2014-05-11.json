I haven't had the chance to play it in a tourney, but that'll change soon. The main idea is that it makes a lot of money, and gets Logos out quickly. It siphons with Overmind installed in order to keep the corp broke, and when they finally score an agenda, you tutor Keyhole. This creates a HUGE window to abuse Keyhole's ability. They are too broke to respond quickly, and since you are Criminal, they have probably dumped their resources into defending HQ. I win most games I play with it, and I am seriously drawing a blank on any games that I have lost -but I have been testing for a while, so there might be one or two losses that have slipped my mind. Admitedly, this deck probably has too much money, but I always find ways to spend it. Once it runs out of money, though, it takes some clever pilotting to recover.

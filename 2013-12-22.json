I mean:\nThis is my first Harmony Deck.\nI think it 's worst enemy will be Silhouette and exposing effects\nFirst turn should look something like: Ice HQ, \neconomy, or MNS a trap, Fetal or GRNDL.  The idea is off course to delay the runner with net damage, some early ETR ice, Hudson 1.0,Unorthodox Predictions and if you get money use the scary Inazuma, Tsurugi.<\/p>\n\n<p>No TOL here, I prefer Burst economy. Only 6 advancable cards that are not Agendas, one of them Ice, it won't be helpful methinks<\/p>\n\n<p>Variations:\n1) Ditch GRNDL, MNS, put 2xJackson, 3xTOL, maybe better FA? \n2)Caduceus or Uroboros? I am confused here. It has a high Rez cost, but at 2 traces at 4, a very storng ETR effect... especially on HQ\n3) with MNS Thomas Haas finally has an advantage on Jinteki decks since it nets you some profit. Ditch GRNDL and a Junebug, put 2x Thomas.<\/p>\n\n<p>Please give me your thoughts<\/p>\n","username":"Greek Geek","cards":{"01057":1,"01069":3,"01070":3,"01075":2,"01077":1,"01078":1,"01098":3,"01103":1,"01110":3,"02014":2,"02015":1,"02019":1,"02032":2,"02120":1,"04013":1,"04015":1,"04033":1,"04051":1,"04053":2,"04074":1,"04099":1,"05001":1,"05005":3,"05015":3,"05016":1}},{"id":1077,"name":"Reina Roja first attempt","creation":"2013-12-22 14:52:55","description":"<p>basically trying to make a deck that takes advantage of \nReina + 1\/2 rook + Xanadu \nalso\nIce carver + Bishop is there to weaken ice.<\/p>\n","username":"JohnnyKronic","cards":{"01002":2,"01007":1,"01008":1,"01010":1,"01011":1,"01012":1,"01014":1,"01015":1,"01034":2,"01044":1,"01050":3,"01051":1,"02004":1,"02022":2,"02028":2,"02041":1,"02045":1,"02047":1,"02050":1,"02061":1,"02062":1,"02069":2,"02082":2,"02091":1,"02101":3,"02102":1,"03035":1,"03054":1,"04002":3,"04003":2,"04021":2,"04041":1,"04042":2,"04043":2,"04049":1}},{"id":1078,"name":"NBN Rush for Egaming.gr","creation":"2013-12-22 16:45:56","description":"\n","username":"PlutoNick","cards":{"01080":1,"01081":3,"01082":2,"01084":2,"01092":2,"01101":1,"01110":3,"01113":2,"02013":2,"02017":3,"02019":2,"02020":3,"02052":2,"02056":3,"02070":3,"02115":3,"03023":2,"03026":3,"04014":2,"04015":3,"04034":3}}]

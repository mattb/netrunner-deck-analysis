Most likely to install Yog.0 on the Dinosaurus early on due to Kit's ability, switch to either Morning Star or Garrote as necessary depending on game state.\n-Exploit Replicator's ability to thin out the deck for more important cards, ie. Tinkering, primary economy cards, Levy AR Lab Access when running out of gas in late game.  Install Dyson Mem Chips in order to get 6 MU + Dino to install all three breakers + 2 Datasuckers.<\/p>\n\n<p>Concerns:\n-No attack on corp economy aside from forcing rezzing ICE.  Long games naturally benefit the runner due to corp draw + decking out, though.  Levy makes sure I don't stall on economy.\n-Program destruction very strong.  However, limited ICE with trash program subroutines, at this point makes that a threat.  Concerns also include facechecking ICE and losing programs from grip due to net damage.<\/p>\n\n<p>As this is my first major attempt at deckbuilding, please feel free to give me feedback!

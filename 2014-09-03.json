I found myself either holding or scrapping Scavenge more often not, or overall just being reluctant to play SOT.<\/p>\n\n<p>The extra mem chip should open up more flexible play earlier in the game, especially with the addition of another Self-modifying Code. After lots of testing, I'm not sure how I feel about Hostage as an answer for dropping Kati and ProCo down to 2, but for that matter, I'm REALLY not sure how I feel about ProCo. If anyone can think of a good change for that block of cards (Kati\/ProCo\/Hostage), I'm all ears.<\/p>\n\n<hr \/>\n\n<p>v5.0: This deck has found the punch it needs. Leaving out Indexing was a huge oversight, and I've thinned out my hardware to make room for 2 copies of it. HQ Interface was dropped from 2 to 1, which freed up 2 inf. for Hostage - and I that let me drop Kati and ProCo both to 2. Trimming a mem chip left me with room for 3 SOT's which, in testing, the deck had been desperately lacking. What we're left with in this version is an efficient deck that can pressure when and where it wants be it through programs or events. And It will only get better once Astrolabe and Trade-In drop.<\/p>\n\n<p>Possible changes include swapping out an Akamatsu for a CyberSolutions, because as it stands now, there are just some games in which you'll have to accept that you can't put down a Sneakdoor because of memory constrictions; but then there are also games where a good Sneakdoor play isn't as efficient as it could be because of early ice on archives, so I don't think the slot warrants the extra 3c to get memory on the board. That could change with more testing.<\/p>\n\n<p>You could also look at swapping out a Datasucker for another Femme because there have been times where being able to bypass multiple pieces of ice is a huge help. But with the inclusion of Same Old Thing to beef up the recurrence Scavenge, I'll be sticking with the extra Datasucker.<\/p>\n\n<p>Imp still wrecks days. I love you, Imp.<\/p>\n\n<p>Smart and patient piloting of this deck turns Personal Workshop from a \"must have\" card in Nasir into an \"awesome to have but not necessary\" card. The breakers are cheap enough that if you keep Kati fed, you can keep your money low and poke around to force rezzes for extra cash. And if you're afraid of nasty ice or a Junebug, tutor out your Deus X, and remember safe practices: don't run last click, leave creds to clear tags, etc. etc.<\/p>\n\n<p>I'd love for people to test this deck and see what they find. The main thing I'm looking for is how to beat the SEA Scorch or Midseasons. That's a big hole in this deck, and I'm open to changes.

Digging for 3 breakers will just take too long so AI breakers look a lot nicer to me. Overmind is the cheaper choice over Crypsis which adds even more speed. Chaos Theory works well with Overmind and will bring the deck size down to 40 cards for even less variance as well as give us tools to tutor and recur Overmind. I\u2019ve seen some successful street chess decks using Overmind recursion and deep red in shaper, which is cheap to import so I\u2019ll drop 3 of those in there too. You\u2019ll need an Inti for Wraparound and tutors for all your programs, so Self Modifying Code, Test Run, and its best friend Scavenge can all go in. Also a Femme because Femme is awesome as well as helping with Swordsman.<\/p>\n\n<p>I like the idea of multi access aggression coupled with the fact you can get in early, cheaply, and with little setup using Overmind. So that means 2 Leg Work, 2 The Makers Eye, 1 Indexing, and 1 Escher for good measure. Same Old Thing works great with the run event cards well.<\/p>\n\n<p>For money, I want a Magnum Opus but I can\u2019t mess with the MU for my Overmind. I\u2019ll put in a Leprechaun which makes for a little bit of work to setup, but I probably will not need it half the games anyway and I only need the tutors for a minimal number of programs, this is more of a back up if the game goes long.

Any tricks, gimmicks, combos, set-ups, they're all gone. Nasir's ability gets worse as the game goes on (whether that knocks him out as a \"viable runner\" is a conversation for another time), so he needs a deck that can capitalize on the early game and the early-mid game.<\/p>\n\n<p>The one thing I'm not entirely happy with is the lack of HQ multi-access in a global meta rife with NEH, though I think that might be mitigated to a degree once Astrolabe drops. It won't serve as a hard-counter, but it will help you up the aggression earlier in the game, so it's an indirect trade.<\/p>\n\n<p>Let me know what you think.<\/p>\n","username":"BTrain","cards":{"01007":1,"01008":3,"01012":1,"01026":1,"01034":3,"01043":1,"02002":2,"02003":1,"02047":3,"02049":3,"02066":1,"02091":3,"02106":3,"02107":3,"03034":3,"03038":3,"03040":3,"03046":3,"03049":3,"04067":1,"06017":1}}]

There's enough multi-access tools and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/03054\">Same Old Thing<\/a> to take advantage of nearly every run once your rig is set up.<\/p>\n\n<p>Just a few notes on some of the card choices:<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"\/en\/card\/05037\">Logos<\/a> - Typically, you'll see <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01024\">Desperado<\/a> or <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01041\">The Toolbox<\/a> in these builds. I ditched <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02087\">Quality Time<\/a> and have lots of ones and twos in this deck, so I like to think of the console as another <a href=\"\/en\/card\/03046\">Self-modifying Code<\/a>, helping me get the card I want to have when I need it. The extra hand size is nice, because there's no Plascretes and I want to hold cards until I can best use them.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"\/en\/card\/03043\">Chakana<\/a> - Depending on who I'm playing, this is a card I'd be willing to mulligan for. Being able to slow down FA is crucial, but more importantly, no other card is going to encourage the Corp to purge more often. If the Corp burns a turn, I'm perfectly happy to hit Magnum for 8 and call it even.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"\/en\/card\/04086\">CyberSolutions Mem Chip<\/a> - Sure, it's worse value than <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01038\">Akamatsu Mem Chip<\/a>, but Kate makes things cheap, and this deck uses A LOT of memory.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"\/en\/card\/02027\">Snowball<\/a> - I wanted two copies of <a href=\"\/en\/card\/05035\">Legwork<\/a>, so I ditched everyone's favourite fracter and went in-faction.

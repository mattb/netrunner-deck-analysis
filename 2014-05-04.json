Iain's style seems to be slow-but-steady-wins-the-race.<\/p>\n\n<p>A combination of Iain's core ability and multiple resources form the bulk of this deck's economy. Rabbit Holes and Borrowed Satellites ensure that Underworld Contacts (a.k.a \"dirty money\") are providing credits early while also enabling a larger hand size. Only five of 40 cards costs more than three credits (18 only cost zero or one!), so a drip economy should be more effective.<\/p>\n\n<p>Because of the large number of resources, tag defense is critical. The high link provided by the Holes and Satellites is coupled with Decoys, New Angeles City Hall, and Compromised Employees. Should the Corp manage to land tags, Crash Space and Fall Guy are there to help mitigate the damage and provide econ in the form of free tag removal.<\/p>\n\n<p>Burst economy is provided by Calling In Favors. With 17 connection resources in the deck, even if you only have half of them installed, CIF should provide significant credits for late-game runs and keep the runner from stalling. Emergency Shutdown provides a counter to expensive ICE that might otherwise slow you down.<\/p>\n\n<p>This deck is also different from most Criminal decks in that it is light on Events. Donut Taganes is included to capitalize on that by providing a small, but steady drain on the Corp's burst economy. He can be trashed in the late-game when you're setup and ready to unleash CIF.<\/p>\n\n<p>Get your network of connections in place as quickly as possible. Use Hostage to get Professional Contacts, Kati Jones, and Donut into play early. With only one copy of each Criminal breaker, you'll need to be mindful where\/when you run.

The idea behind this deck is the same as it his in his deck.\nMake multiple runs against this deck's centrals or a single run on a remote as expensive\/painful as possible. The runner will spend most of his turns drawing cards and trying to get his economy back up which gives you a scoring window. If not, this deck can kill a careless runner.\nI won't go into too much detail since db0 does a much better job explaining the concept. I'll just explain my changes to his version:<\/p>\n\n<p>Agendas: I changed the Agenda Suite to one that taxes the runner even more. I lose the incredible strength of Nisei MK2 and the deck becomes a little bit slower because of it but having three of both NAPD Contract and Fetal AI coupled with The Future Perfect means that a poor Runner cannot take Agendas from you. Multi-access strategies via Maker's Eye, RDI etc become not only hilariously expensive but dangerous as well since a Snare into Fetal or Shock can easily be deadly depending on the ICE protecting RnD.\nThe only Agenda that remains accessible the usual way is Philotic Entanglement. Before H&amp;P, this used to be Braintrust, just to fill it up to 20 points. I never got the ability going (which with a whole 12 ICE ain't too good anyway). Philotic is filling the same spot being the one Agenda rounding the count out to 20 but it has more uses. Your opponent will notice  quickly that you play rather expensive agendas and stops running your unrezzed and un-advanced remotes after a couple turns or if you got a suitable amount of unrezzed remotes already (like Protocols, Jacksons, Snares mebbe etc) so you can easily sneak a cheeky Philotic out. Your opponent might get ahead on the Agenda count and score a few before you get going resulting in you sniping a couple cards from their hand. You spent your turn advancing, they spend their turn drawing up again, effectively wasting their turn and you got 2 points for it. Fair deal.<\/p>\n\n<p>Assets: The only change I made here is Mental Health Clinic over PAD Campaign which is something I'm testing at the moment and so far it has been amazing. On paper, it looks rather terrible. Giving your opponent more cards to hold in a deck that deals net damage? In practice, it works a lot better since your opponent still has to draw his cards and spend clicks on that. The real advantage lies in its rez cost. Not having to play 2 to rez is just amazing. Usually, you're faced with quite a dilemma in the early game: Rezzing ICE or activating a Snare and then not having enough money to rez your PAD campaign resulting in you wasting a turn trying to get some credits to rez the Campaign later, again throwing you back in the credit department. With the clinic, that is gone. You gain a 2 click advantage right off the start and can plan much more precisely what cards you want to play. It does mean, however, that Ronin becomes worse. I had already taken him out before H&amp;P but now, there is a more intriguing option:<\/p>\n\n<p>Operations: A singleton copy of Diversified portfolio may seem odd (it rather is, actually, I just wanted to test it) but it's a card you want in the mid to late game and you don't want to draw too many, so one is actually quite okay. In this deck, you can easily make 6-8 credits with it and use it as great monetary recovery after a big assault where you rezzed a lot of cards. Who needs Restructure when you got 8 remotes (and some of those make money too!).<\/p>\n\n<p>ICE: Komainu for 1 Tsurugi because they do similar things, with Komainu being less flexible but he is way more taxing and works well with the Clinics and even better with his BFF Hokusai Grid. Enigma over Data Pike because clicks are hard to come by facing this deck.\nThe Deck is still in a testing phase but a blast to play with if you like micromanagement in Netrunner. \n...And somehow I spent more time explaining a couple changes than the original deck's creator spent explaining the entire deck. Oh well, I hope, if you made it this far, you at least enjoyed it a bit.<\/p>\n","username":"accless","cards":{"01070":2,"01078":1,"01084":2,"01104":3,"01111":1,"02013":2,"02029":3,"02031":1,"02032":3,"02060":2,"02095":3,"04015":3,"04033":1,"04054":3,"04060":3,"04073":3,"04074":2,"04093":1,"04119":3,"05006":1,"05007":2,"05009":3,"05017":1,"05026":1}},{"id":4988,"name":"Slow Leaks - Patient DLR","creation":"2014-05-04 06:07:29","description":"<p>The exact opposite of the usual DLR Anarch deck.

Hostage also helps you to find your silver bullets when needed : decoy vs scorched earth decks (CI and Supermodernism) as SEA source is often the bottleneck of their combo, scrubber vs asset-based econs (Jinteki RP and NBN), the source vs fast advance (CI mostly, but also HB and NBN).

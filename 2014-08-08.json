With TPS on Ninja you just need 5 credits to be safe from Trash Program subs, which then means you just need either Xanadu or a Rook.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Escher<\/strong>: one of the strongest Shaper cards, hardly used though, it's possibly the strongest weapon of all this deck. Nasir loves to run against unrezzed ice, especially when set up with Xanadu and a Rook. Swap the rezzed ice with unrezzed ice on the server you need to run into, and you're done. There's hardly a case where you can be stopped when each ice costs them 3 more credits to break then normal.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Emptying the credit pool before you actually encounter a rezzed ice is extremely important, unless you fancy losing money needlessly, so that's why you have <strong>Personal Workshop<\/strong>, <strong>Clone Chip<\/strong> and <strong>Self-modifying Code<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n<p>Paid abilities are your best friends here, since you can <em>\"waste away\"<\/em> your money to pay for Icebreakers, Plascretes, <em>whatever<\/em> just so you're broke right before getting some cash thanks to the Corp. I must admit there's something incredibly satisfying in being helped by your enemy!<\/p>\n\n<p>Considering how bad is <strong>Creeper<\/strong> (not in general, but very much so for Nasir), I had to spend two influence points for Ninja. Could have gone with two copies of <strong>Femme Fatale<\/strong>, which is a good option too (also due to TPT), but 9 credits to install are a lot, for a Runner that spends half his time being broke.\nIf I had influence left for 2 copies of <strong>Stimhack<\/strong>, and not just one, I might have gone with FF, but Ninja still feels a better choice also because of Archer.<\/p>\n\n<p>Lastly, I didn't mention <strong>Xanadu<\/strong> as a key card of the deck motly because Rook is much better, but whenever you draw the Anarch resource, install it as soon as possible. One extra credit is often the difference between an abrupt stop, and a flawless run.\nPop-up Window isn't really a big deal anyway (you can always stop, click a credit, and run again), but with Xanadu it gives you the money you need right away, and that means no clicks wasted.<\/p>\n\n<p>My advices, when playing Nasir, would be the following:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>manage your economy perfectly, wasting money is a sin; losing one credit might be A-Okay, but losing more might get you in trouble;<\/li>\n<li>don't rush your decisions, because running just to have the Corp spend money into rezzing suddenly is not such a good idea anymore, you need the money from those juicy pieces of ice, now;<\/li>\n<li>keep some money on Kati (if you can), because you might need a boost to your economy later on, and also keep a <strong>Sure Gamble<\/strong> ready to make an expensive run if you really have to<\/li>\n<li><strong>Escher<\/strong>, <strong>Indexing<\/strong> and <strong>Stimhack<\/strong> are your tricks, don't spoil them too early and use them when you can achieve the maximum effect, so don't go using Indexing on unrezzed ice on R&amp;D, because you might not have enough money to go there again to steal those Agenda you saw. Escher can radically shift the game in your favor in mid or late game, so I don't really see the need to use it earlier. If they don't know you have Stimhack they can lull themselves into a false sense of security, but it's a one-time-only option so use it wisely.<\/li>\n<li>since you really need at least some of the key cards and some credit-removal option (PW - CC - SMC) in early game, don't hesitate playing <strong>Levy AR Lab Access<\/strong>, those 5 credits would have been wasted on the first run anyway. And waiting is bad, because the Corp might notice your uneasiness and rush things on, leaving you behind.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Now, talking about the deck's own problems:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>the economy could use a bit of help. In those occasions where you need to move faster, you might notice you actually lack some credits here and there, so <em>Fast Advance<\/em> heavy decks are probably your worst enemy.<\/li>\n<li><strong>NAPD<\/strong> is quite difficult to steal. I usually ignore this one, unless it's late game, where it shouldn't be a problem. If you really want or have to steal it, you should probably force the Corp into giving you the money for it by having them pay extra, but that might take too much time to set up. I'm way more worried by <strong>Utopia Shard<\/strong>, though. If that is scored, your best bet would then to go for R&amp;D with Indexing.<\/li>\n<li>Jinteki shouldn't be so dangerous because of the cost of their AP ice, which basically gives you all the money you need by itself, but of course traps can be pretty nasty, so you should abuse <strong>Deus Ex<\/strong> to avoid stuff like <strong>Psychic Field<\/strong> or <strong>Snare!<\/strong> from completely ruining your plans. Traps heavy decks which rely on very little ice can be weird, but shouldn't be a problem since you can also work your economy like any other runner out there, it's still an option for Nasir after all, when no unrezzed ice is involved.<\/li>\n<li>Traces can also be annoying, so you should always break them, but <strong>Bernice Mai<\/strong> or <strong>Ash 2X3ZB9CY<\/strong> can both be a real problem. No real trick about them either, you just need to trash them or work around them somehow. The deck could benefit a lot from <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01039\">Rabbit Hole<\/a>, and I might add at least a couple by removing <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02089\">Creeper<\/a> (never actually used it, since you can recover <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01027\">Ninja<\/a> with CC anyway) and a single <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01034\">Diesel<\/a>. We'll see.<\/li>\n<li>Worth mentioning that <strong>Corporate Troubleshooter<\/strong> could be problematic as well, but it really depends on the rez cost of the ice, and the credits the Corp has left after paying an increased rez cost. No real protection from this Upgrade though, so things could get hectic if you end up facing it. One suggestion would be to avoid using all the copies of Clone Chip, cause you might wanna be able to recover an Icebreaker in case something like this goes wrong.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>All in all, i've been pleasantly surprised by Nasir's own playstyle, which makes the Corp quite uneasy about rezzing stuff and allows for a totally different approach to the game.\nDefinitely like this identity and the fact that it has enough versatility to be built in many different ways. Another good option would be with stealth-powered breakers such as <a href=\"\/en\/card\/06077\">Switchblade<\/a>, and cards like <a href=\"\/en\/card\/06040\">Ghost Runner<\/a> plus enough recurring credits to go on running.<\/p>\n","username":"paddosan","cards":{"01004":1,"01027":1,"01034":3,"01040":3,"01050":3,"01053":3,"02007":2,"02009":2,"02027":2,"02049":3,"02066":2,"02082":2,"02089":1,"02091":2,"02106":2,"03031":2,"03035":1,"03038":3,"03046":2,"04003":3,"04042":2,"06017":1}},{"id":8381,"name":"Nasir's Toolbox","creation":"2014-08-08 07:19:28","description":"<p>Nasir definitely seems to be at his best with two key things: recurring credits and credit sinks.<\/p>\n\n<p>I feel like the best tools that Nasir has access to are:\nClone Chip\nSelf-Modifying Code\nAtman.<\/p>\n\n<p>Specifically, the interactions between those cards is key.  When encountering a piece of ice, the ability to Self-Modifying Code into an Atman that breaks that ice for cheap is absolutely devastating.  It dumps all of your credits, and then uses the credits that the Corp had spent to rez the ice to walk right on through the ice.  It is back breaking and unbelievably powerful.  Meanwhile, you can Clone Chip to retrieve anything that is trashed, or you can just pick up the Self-Modifying Code again to do it again.  Automatic 3-of for all three of those cards.<\/p>\n\n<p>Regarding the rest of the Icebreaker suite, Battering Ram and Gordian Blade do the heavy lifting once the Corp starts to build up Ice.  They remain strong through entire runs and they are fantastic credit sinks. Femme Fatale supplements the Atmans to handle Sentry Ice.  They are all 1-of because you primarily want to use a toolbox approach where you are using Self-Modifying Code or Test Run to search them up as needed.<\/p>\n\n<p>For the rest of the programs, we have a one-two punch of Viruses, some recurring credit engines, and then Rook.<\/p>\n\n<p>Cloak and Sahasrara fund the economy of the deck, allowing us to continue using our Icebreakers and install new programs without worrying to much about our actual credit pool.<\/p>\n\n<p>Datasucker and Parasite help to control the ice that does build up, either comboing together to trash problem ice, or just helping use the credits we do have to break the rest of the ice effectively.  If the corp spends a turn purging virus counters, then we are winning.<\/p>\n\n<p>Rook is just incredible in this deck.  It makes the identity even stronger, and it punishes the corp for placing ice.  It also helps to mitigate the impact of Pop-up Window and other small ice during the late game.<\/p>\n\n<p>Moving on to the Resources, this is where the economy and engine of the deck lives.  Kati has always been good, but she is so much better in Nasir than anywhere else.  Rather than having a credit pool of your own, you just really need to store credits on Kati.  When you need the credits, pull them off Kati and go to town.  This keeps the deck running.<\/p>\n\n<p>Professional Contacts is another strong element.  This deck needs to dig through cards quickly and without using credit.  Trading Clicks for cards and credits at the same time is what you want to be doing, and this card is key.<\/p>\n\n<p>Personal Workshop is also key because it allows you to sink your credits into things without over-committing to anything.<\/p>\n\n<p>Inside Man is the last piece, and it helps to fuel the pretty heavy Hardware suite with recurring credits.<\/p>\n\n<p>Regarding the Hardware suite, Cyberfeeder is another recurring credit engine, which also helps to install Viruses if needed.  The Mem Chips are present to facilitate the MU of the deck.  I could see swapping the CyberSolutions chips for Dyson Mem Chips, because the Dyson Mem Chips also help to shore up the vulnerability to Traces.  The Toolbox is also extremely key because it provide much needed MU, a buff to your Link to help mitigate traces, and 2 recurring credits.  It is absolutely insane for this deck, and does everything that you want it to.  As much as I dislike cramming two Plascretes, it is pretty much necessary to not get flatlined by Scorched.  Finally, R&amp;D Interface gives some late game reach to get those last points.<\/p>\n\n<p>Finally, the Events.  Three Diesel and one Quality Time, because we want to dig, but we don't want to pay any credits to do it.  Two Test Run to help search up the needed programs for the strategy to work.<\/p>\n\n<p>Overall, Nasir's ability gives you a massive click advantage over the course of the game, and can generate tons of credits.  By the mid game, you want to have the Corp in a position where they need to be placing big expensive ice to even hope to stop you.  That is when Nasir generates the biggest gains, and it is what makes him dangerous.  Against Nasir, the Corp is not going to want to play their expensive ice, so you can just decimate them with your high efficiency Icebreakers until they start popping big ice to stop you.  When they start rezzing the big ice, you start to generate a lot of advantage.<\/p>\n","username":"Morkins1","cards":{"01005":2,"01008":2,"01012":2,"01026":1,"01034":3,"01041":2,"01042":1,"01043":1,"02009":2,"02047":2,"02049":2,"02068":1,"02087":1,"02091":2,"02107":2,"03038":3,"03040":3,"03041":2,"03046":3,"03047":2,"03049":2,"04003":2,"04086":2,"06017":1}},{"id":8382,"name":"Marathon","creation":"2014-08-08 07:44:38","description":"\n","username":"Chaotic134","cards":{"01003":2,"01014":3,"01018":3,"01021":2,"01026":2,"01028":2,"01031":1,"01051":2,"01053":2,"02004":1,"02027":2,"02064":1,"02085":2,"02086":2,"02091":2,"02104":1,"05030":1,"05032":2,"05035":2,"05036":2,"05038":2,"05043":2}},{"id":8384,"name":"stealth operative","creation":"2014-08-08 10:00:40","description":"<p>Different icebreaker approach.

Silhouette with Blackgaurd is good, but Andromeda said it best when she said \"Snitch is a girl's best friend.\" Ideally you want to get Snitch out on click one, then run 3 times and make them spend anywhere from 5 to 20 creds. Be weary with any new ice they out out, as it will probably be cheap ice to stop you from hitting the more expensive ice. You then emergency shutdown the big pieces of ice, and either make them lose more money or kill them with FAO. At this point the game basically turns into a Deep Red scenario, except you're never going to run out of pieces and have a lot more tricks for your runs.<\/p>\n\n<p>Escher is a game changer.

With Inside Job and Femme, the only way they can truly lock you out of an outer server is if they have 3 code gates in a row. At that point you probably can just win by hitting other servers.

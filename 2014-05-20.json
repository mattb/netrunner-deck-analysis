An overclocked Vitruvius (I tend to overadvance it by two, in my mind treating it like a 5\/3 agenda) enables me to potentially neural emp the runner three times, or to pull back econ cards or snares just before the runner access HQ, whilst Sentinel Defence Program makes all the brain damage my deck can put out just that little bit scarier. Project Wotan is only in there to reduce agenda density by virtue of it being a 5\/3. Sometimes those extra end the run subs are useful, and I do take them into account, but irritatingly they can also screw up any ambushes I am playing, so it's a bit swings and roundabouts.<\/p>\n\n<p>Economy: Pretty standard I feel, ETF helps out a little, and I will quite happily click Melange four turns in a row whilst slowly refilling my hand. The extra money is a killer, especially if an Adonis is ticking down at the same time, and I don't mind giving the runner all that breathing space, for reasons that hopefully will become apparent. <\/p>\n\n<p>Ice: All my ice is designed to be taxing as hell, and to encourage the runner to occasionally take the odd bit of brain damage to enable them to get into a server at what they perceive to be a crucial moment (i.e. a moment with a Cerebral sitting at the end of said server). It is an expensive set up, but I have the money for it, and I don't tend to run that many remotes, one or two on average, one of those being my \"main\" remote server which I score agendas or ambushes out of. The inazuma are both in there to assist with sticking brain damage to a runner, and tend to go on centrals. It's nice to put them in front of Heimdalls, but that is not always possible. However, if I have installed a Victor in front of HQ turn one, and then install TWO inazuma directly in front of it, I will almost certainly guarantee some brain damage the first time round, and then after that, have created a monstrously taxing server (the average break cost of an inazuma is 6 credits, the third most costly ice) at the low low price of just 3 credits per piece of ice. It pretty much locks the runner out of one of my centrals. Otherwise, obviously, pile the bioroids up as high as possible to stack their effects and prevent click throughs. Sherlock 1.0 is a rather useful tempo controller, again being a very expensive piece of ice to break, difficult to click through due to the subs, and if they let the subs fire, enabling me to slow them down even further. Viktor 2.0 also deserves a mention, as if I can get that hosted power counter condition to fire, it enables me to kill the runner in one turn with a single neural emp, an overclocked Vitruvius if they only have three cards in hand, I can do it with four cards with either a sentinel defence program score or a second counter.<\/p>\n\n<p>Ambushes: With 6 ambushes to 9 agendas in my deck, I can guarantee a relatively consistent draw of them, and I treat them exactly the same way I treat almost any agenda. Obviously, the problem with them is working out precisely when to put them down and when to score an agenda, but I can normally time them relatively well. Snares stay in my hand as a defence against HQ runs, and get pulled back by Vitruvius' if they get trashed out. Two snares can really ruin an overconfident runners day when they just ran legwork on your three card hand.<\/p>\n\n<p>In terms of playing it, ice up the centrals, and ice up a single, very taxing scoring server. That server is where traps and agendas go, and should be as punishing as possible for the runner. I sometimes end up icing that server 5 deep, which means that runner can only make a single run on it before bankruptcy, and I can use that to my advantage. The traps tend to work more in the mid-game, when I don't have a server that impregnable, but if I've hit them with a cerebral in the mid game and given them a couple of brain damage, it really makes their job a whole lot harder in the late game. Adonis' and Melange tend to go into single ice remotes where they can be left to their own devices and fuel the horrifically expensive ice that protects the important bits.<\/p>\n\n<p>My only problems with the deck, are that bar neural emp I have no real way to actually get the runner myself (unless they float tags from a snare), and that occasionally my economy just doesn't get going, but that is just luck of the draw. I am toying with putting the eve campaign in, but I'm not sure what I would get rid of, as there aren't any cards that I really wouldn't want to come up.<\/p>\n","username":"herod1204","cards":{"01054":1,"01056":3,"01061":3,"01063":2,"01069":3,"01070":2,"01072":2,"01108":3,"01110":3,"01113":3,"02030":2,"02051":3,"02110":3,"03006":3,"03007":3,"03009":3,"03015":3,"03019":3,"05016":2}},{"id":5803,"name":"Ken the Big Rig Driver","creation":"2014-05-20 12:52:20","description":"<p>Atypical criminal deck running a big rig. Started out as a fun experiment to build a criminal deck that didn't use the standard anarch  breakers. After countless  iterations, it ended up pretty good and won me a tournament :)<\/p>\n\n<p>The deck revolves around installing your rig as fast as possible. Preferably, the first one you should install is Morning Star, followed by Torch. You have multiple tools to do so: Stimhack + Savoir-Faire\/Clone chip, Siphon money, or even Dirty Laundry + Security testing. The preferred way is to Stimhack+Savoir-Faire, although don't tunnel vision on that and be afraid to hard-cast your Morning star. <\/p>\n\n<p>Once you're set-up, you're pretty much unstoppable. You will win by run volume, rather than run quality. This puts a lot of pressure on the corp because cards like Ash and Caprice are not all that taxing. Security testing will be your long-term source of income, although once you're set up, you need very little money to make runs.<\/p>\n\n<p>Crescentus is a key insight for this deck in favor of Emergency shutdown. Even though runs are very cheap for the big rig, there are always the occasional annoying ices that cost a bit too much (ie. 4+ credits). Examples include: Grim, Ichi, Archer, Tollbooth. For sentries, the standard way to deal with them is Faerie, but it is a one-shot process, therefore you need Crescentus to lock it down. For Tollbooth, Torch costs 5 creds which is acceptable to pay one time, therefore you want to derez it after you pay that. Crescentus also combos really well with Savoir-Faire.<\/p>\n\n<p>The other weakness is big barriers that Morning star can't deal with. To solve this issue, I use a combo of Crescentus+Grappling Hook + E3. Against Bioroid ices, just E3 is needed. The most annoying ones are the Weyland ones where you need the full combo. Thankfully, those are not rezzed that often, although with oversight AI they could be annoying (but then you don't need Crescentus).<\/p>\n\n<p>Quality time is another really important card to draw into your rig quickly. You can also discard breakers to activate Clone chip + Stimhack, although that's not the preferable way to get them into play. It's better to keep Clone chip in case your rig gets trashed (usually this only happens through AggSec, since destroyers are not a big issue), or to recur Crescentus\/Grappling hook. Clone chip is also useful in case a Stimhack makes you lose a breaker in hand.<\/p>\n\n<p>The deck is lacking multi-card access. Those would definitely be appreciated but not necessary. Probably the most viable is Legwork since it doesn't cost any influence. More experimentation is needed to determine what can be cut for it.<\/p>\n","username":"johncraven","cards":{"01004":2,"01018":3,"01022":3,"01024":3,"01026":1,"01050":3,"02004":1,"02009":2,"02024":2,"02065":3,"02087":3,"02104":3,"03038":2,"03052":3,"03054":3,"04047":1,"04105":3,"05029":1,"05045":2,"05048":2}},{"id":5804,"name":"Andy Mafia Princess","creation":"2014-05-20 13:36:35","description":"\n","username":"CodeMarvelous","cards":{"01007":2,"01018":3,"01022":2,"01024":3,"01026":1,"01043":1,"01050":3,"01051":1,"02008":1,"02009":2,"02043":3,"02069":3,"02083":1,"02105":1,"02107":2,"03054":2,"03055":1,"04004":3,"04065":1,"04106":3,"05031":3,"05035":2,"05050":2}},{"id":5805,"name":"Replicating Babies","creation":"2014-05-20 14:45:12","description":"<p>This is the current iteration of my RP deck I've been playing for the last few months.

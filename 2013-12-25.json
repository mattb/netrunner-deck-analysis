No R&amp;D interface. WiRD is your R&amp;D search. With WiRD in play you can keep a solid track of what's your opponent is drawing and where its best to run. If your opponent leaves the agenda in R&amp;D run it. If they draw it run HQ, that's why there's 2 HQ interface. The corp can't make a right choice. I'm debating dropping the fairie for an imp just to trash annoying cards but I think the early pressure it gives me while I find a dagger and cloak or two is worth it. DMC and toolbox are great for the extra MU and link.  This deck needs the MU and I never regret the link. Nothing like saying \"5\" when asked what your current link str is. :)\nThat 5 link kept a sea source worthless in one game. The midseasons rep still cost me all my money but I got rid of the 2 tags next turn with a MO in play. \nI'm still wanting to get my third WiRD back in though.<\/p>\n","username":"HepatitvsJ","cards":{"01007":1,"01033":1,"01034":3,"01035":3,"01041":2,"01044":2,"01050":3,"02007":1,"02009":2,"02028":3,"02043":3,"02066":1,"02085":2,"02087":3,"02104":1,"03035":2,"03038":3,"03041":3,"03042":2,"03046":3,"04048":2}},{"id":1108,"name":"Professor","creation":"2013-12-25 04:57:32","description":"\n","username":"Link","cards":{"01004":1,"01007":1,"01008":1,"01009":1,"01010":1,"01011":1,"01012":1,"01014":1,"01027":1,"01028":1,"01034":2,"01041":1,"01043":1,"01047":1,"01050":3,"02003":1,"02004":1,"02006":1,"02027":1,"02041":1,"02065":1,"02104":1,"03029":1,"03033":3,"03035":1,"03038":3,"03039":1,"03041":3,"03042":2,"03043":1,"03046":3,"03049":3}},{"id":1109,"name":"The New Flatline 1.0","creation":"2013-12-25 07:29:57","description":"<p>Toying around with some new Corp cards, trying to find a fresh way to flatline.

Props for Mushin-ing a GRNDL Refinery and getting away with it. <\/p>\n\n<p>Chairman Hiro sits perfectly in Jinteki : PE. Always rez him after the runner's last click. <\/p>\n\n<p>Pack Clone Retirements for Archers and Fenrises. They're your get-out-of-jail cards and more.<\/p>\n\n<p>Also, Fenris is a thing of beauty.

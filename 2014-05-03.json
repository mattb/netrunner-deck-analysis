I dropped modded, because i almost exclusively used it to bring out my toolbox. I also removed the armitages and one lucky find to put in three Magnum Opus. <\/p>\n\n<p>The economy engine works really really well and i dont have money problems at all. <\/p>\n\n<p>Another change i made was to drop chakana and use legwork as a weapon against fast advance instead. To get more versatility i replaced the r&amp;d-interfaces with indexing and added more SoT. <\/p>\n\n<p>Original Critical Hit-Deck:\nThis deck works as a mixture between fast and big rig. Although you try to establish your rig as fast as possible you are able to run early without worrying too much about traps and destroyers thanks to smc, clone-chip, deus x and sharpshooter. The burst-eco cards and kate's ability in addition should help getting out anything you need as fast as possible (e.g. an early toolbox). Although this deck is more or less able to run often, it is recommended to primarly focus on getting the rig out and make worthy runs.<\/p>\n\n<p>The clone chips are not only good for getting out a trashed sharpshooter or deus x, they also work great with kate's ability to get a cloak or something cheaper during the corps turn.<\/p>\n\n<p>Chakana and r&amp;d interface are obviously there for r&amp;d pressure and to slow down fast advance alot. I am still considering to drop chakana for something more worthy though, to keep the pressure on another server as well (hq\/archives).<\/p>\n\n<p>Silencer, cloak and dagger are my cheap tools to defeat almost any sentry. The only thing that can stop this combo is an ice-deep server with lots of high strength sentries in it, but this doesnt happen too often, and if i realize, that this might be the case, i just can use sharpshooter and deus x if needed.<\/p>\n\n<p>Modded is mainly used for hardware like toolbox and the interfaces.<\/p>\n\n<p>Levy AR and SoT are my panic buttons, because it sometimes may happen, that i draw through my stack very fast, and with Levy i just can restart and play all my beautiful burst economy cards again.<\/p>\n\n<p>I am still unsure what to use instead of chakana, so any considerations are highly appreciated.<\/p>\n\n<p>I only had the chance to playtest the deck a few times, but everything seemed to work quite well and i didn't loose a game until now. Edit: -1 Akamatsu MemChip, because i realized, that zu13 costs zero MU, as soon as toolbox hits the table :)<\/p>\n","username":"Oneiro","cards":{"01033":1,"01034":3,"01041":3,"01044":3,"01049":2,"01050":3,"02007":1,"02009":2,"02027":1,"02066":1,"02087":2,"02106":2,"03035":1,"03038":3,"03041":3,"03042":2,"03046":3,"03054":3,"04067":1,"04104":2,"04109":2,"05035":2}},{"id":4964,"name":"Untrashable v6","creation":"2014-05-03 18:36:54","description":"<p>The Untrashable for the Honor &amp; Profit era. I can't express how much The Future Perfect helps this deck<\/p>\n\n<hr \/>\n\n<p>This deck is built on the idea that running any single remote against Jinteki:RP is going to be more expensive, and then makes your assets and upgrades even more costly to trash with Encryption Protocols.<\/p>\n\n<p>Eventually you want a good pile of money plus Ash + Hokusai Combo with some Encryption Protocols on the side. Effectively you would force the runner to have to waste 3 clicks, take 2 damage and spend a good pile of credits just to take a look at a remote once. Then you recur your Ash with Howards or Interns.<\/p>\n\n<p>Sundew is the star of this deck. Protect it early with a Chimera or leave it unprotected if the runner does not trash assets and it can proivide a truckload of money over the course of the game.<\/p>\n\n<p>This is a version with less econ (just 6 assets) but with Archives punishment instead. Those in turn function kinda like a soft econ, as you can drop them in archives and discourage sucker\/desperado runs without using any ICE. Unfortunately the runner can still run and jackout without accessing, so eventually you'll prolly want something light as well there, like a shadow.<\/p>\n\n<p>Because shocks and shi.kyu discourage Archives access, very often you'll be able to hide one or two agendas in there for a longer time than usual, giving you a breather.<\/p>\n\n<p>Closed Accounts might seem like a weird card in this deck, but it has caught a lot of players unaware, especially if they gathered a few tags from shadows before this hit the table. However it's there primarily for counter to tag-me\/siphon runners, because otherwise they will walk all over you.<\/p>\n","username":"db0","cards":{"01068":3,"01070":2,"01078":1,"01084":2,"01104":3,"01109":3,"02013":2,"02029":3,"02031":1,"02032":3,"02060":2,"02095":3,"02112":1,"04015":3,"04054":3,"04060":3,"04073":1,"04074":3,"04093":1,"04119":1,"05007":2,"05011":2,"05018":2}},{"id":4966,"name":"kate parasite","creation":"2014-05-03 19:53:35","description":"\n","username":"agentkuo","cards":{"01006":2,"01008":3,"01012":2,"01026":1,"01033":1,"01036":2,"01038":3,"01043":1,"01044":2,"01050":3,"02009":2,"02047":3,"02066":1,"02106":3,"03035":1,"03038":3,"03040":3,"03046":3,"03048":1,"03052":3,"03054":2,"04067":1}},{"id":4969,"name":"Jinkteki Wall","creation":"2014-05-03 21:15:36","description":"\n","username":"foldor","cards":{"01068":2,"01069":2,"01079":1,"01103":3,"01110":3,"02033":3,"02060":2,"04015":2,"04114":3,"04117":2,"04120":3,"05001":1,"05005":3,"05007":3,"05011":3,"05015":3,"05020":1,"05023":1}},{"id":4970,"name":"Fune","creation":"2014-05-03 21:59:43","description":"<p>It's the Japanese gambling boat.<\/p>\n","username":"JBFlanz","cards":{"01057":1,"01064":1,"01070":2,"01075":1,"01077":2,"01078":2,"01084":2,"01090":2,"01110":3,"02015":3,"02032":1,"02040":1,"02073":1,"04012":3,"04074":1,"04076":3,"04114":3,"04115":1,"04119":3,"05002":1,"05004":1,"05006":1,"05007":3,"05009":3,"05013":3,"05016":1,"05017":1}},{"id":4971,"name":"Monolithic Studios","creation":"2014-05-03 22:19:08","description":"<p>Draw a bunch of cards and get your monolith out, perhaps with the help of the personal workshop plus stimhack combo.

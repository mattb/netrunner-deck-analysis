And it\u2019s strong, fast, and consistent. With the release of Honor &amp; Profit it got some fantastic new tools. First, let us take a step back and think about the strengths of this faction which will feed into the deck philosophy.<\/p>\n\n<p>Deck Philosophy<\/p>\n\n<p>Our company, NBN, is active in the business of media and advertising. And let\u2019s face it, media and advertising is a business with high margins and high returns on investment. The true power of NBN is gaining high returns on a relative small investment. Small investments, high returns.<\/p>\n\n<p>As an example, let\u2019s take <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02056\">Pop-up Window<\/a>. It takes a very small investment to install and rez it. But its benefits are relatively large in comparison to its costs, whether it\u2019s the credits gained by you, the credits paid by the runner, or the consumption of a Parasite. A card with a high return on investment.<\/p>\n\n<p>In the game of Android: Netrunner, the ultimate return on investment comes in the form of agenda points. And NBN simply has some of the best agendas with highest returns on investment, notably <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01081\">AstroScript Pilot Program<\/a>, <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02115\">Project Beale<\/a>, and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01082\">Breaking News<\/a>. When you think of <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01081\">AstroScript Pilot Program<\/a> in terms of return on investment, you\u2019ll understand it\u2019s simply great. For an investment of install and triple advance, you\u2019ll get a return of two agenda points and one advancement token ready for further agenda scoring.<\/p>\n\n<p>On top of its great agendas NBN has some high return on investment tools available to search and fast advance these agendas with a lightning speed, notably <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01092\">SanSan City Grid<\/a>, <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01059\">Biotic Labor<\/a>, and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/05027\">Fast Track<\/a>. More on these great tools later.<\/p>\n\n<p>Another attribute of NBN in general and of \u2018Mad Men\u2019 specifically is that you are able to operate very well even in a situation with only a small number of credits. This deck hardly needs or has more than nine credits. This decks has cards with a high short-term return on investment.<\/p>\n\n<p>To summarize, the deck philosophy of \u2018Mad Men\u2019 is to use NBN\u2019s high return on investment attributes to score seven agenda points with the speed of lightning. <\/p>\n\n<p>Deck Strategy<\/p>\n\n<p>The objective of the deck is simple: get the Astrotrain rolling, score three two-pointers and finish off with a <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01082\">Breaking News<\/a>. Therefore, the first goal is to score that first <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01081\">AstroScript Pilot Program<\/a> as quickly as possible. To do this you\u2019ll need to mulligan, draw or <a href=\"\/en\/card\/05027\">Fast Track<\/a> into the first AstroScript. Additionally you\u2019ll need to have either an installed <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01092\">SanSan City Grid<\/a> (and 8 credits), a <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01059\">Biotic Labor<\/a> in hand (and 7 credits), or have a reasonable secure remote server (and sufficient credits).<\/p>\n\n<p>Let\u2019s discuss scoring agendas in terms of return on investment. \u2018Mad Men\u2019 is indifferent to the way to score an agenda, whether it\u2019s fast advance or via a remote server. What it is does care about is to score the agendas with the highest return on investment. You\u2019re always analysing the available possibilities to score your agendas. On top of that \u2018Mad Men\u2019 has efficient tools to increase the available scoring possibilities. Its flexibility to score agendas in different ways makes this deck strong and consistent. <\/p>\n\n<p>For fast advancement the deck has available three copies of <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01092\">SanSan City Grid<\/a> and two copies of <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01059\">Biotic Labor<\/a>. Three copies of <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01092\">SanSan City Grid<\/a> are great as I love runners to spend their credits to get in the remote and trash the SanSan. And then I have another copy ready to install. For the optimal number copies of <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01059\">Biotic Labor<\/a> I did a lot of testing, and I found to prefer two copies over three. Furthermore, the four points of influence I\u2019d happily spend on another beauty.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"\/en\/card\/05027\">Fast Track<\/a> is one of the most important cards of \u2018Mad Men\u2019. Firstly, it allows you to search for the first <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01081\">AstroScript Pilot Program<\/a>, to get that Astrotrain rolling. Secondly, with an available AstroScript token and either an installed <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01092\">SanSan City Grid<\/a> or a <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01059\">Biotic Labor<\/a> in hand, you can use <a href=\"\/en\/card\/05027\">Fast Track<\/a> to score the next AstroScript straight from R&amp;D. And finally you\u2019ll use Fast Track to search for <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01082\">Breaking News<\/a> to score the last point and win the game. <a href=\"\/en\/card\/05027\">Fast Track<\/a> allows you to find what you\u2019ll need, and does that for very a low cost. It\u2019s return on investment is simply fantastic. I\u2019ll happily have three copies of <a href=\"\/en\/card\/05027\">Fast Track<\/a> in the deck.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now it\u2019s a good point the discuss the identity of the deck. <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02114\">NBN: The World is Yours*<\/a> is great for this deck. Firstly, the six card hand allows you to use <a href=\"\/en\/card\/05027\">Fast Track<\/a> more aggressively. When the window is right, search for the agenda you\u2019ll need for your next turn and hide it in your six card HQ. This really works well. Secondly, the lower deck size of TWIY* really increases consistency. A deck size of 44 cards is preferable to 40 cards for a lower agenda density, while you\u2019ll still be able to find your agendas quickly enough using <a href=\"\/en\/card\/05027\">Fast Track<\/a>. <\/p>\n\n<p>Draw engine<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2018Mad Men\u2019 is a quick deck and quick decks benefit from burst card drawing. The two greatest burst drawing cards are <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01083\">Anonymous Tip<\/a> and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04090\">Blue Level Clearance<\/a>. I use two copies of the both of them. Both cards quickly draw the cards I\u2019ll need for winning, while filling HQ to its six cards. Both cards carry the core attribute of \u2018Mad Men\u2019; high returns on investment. <a href=\"\/en\/card\/05027\">Fast Track<\/a> obviously completes the high return on investment draw engine of this deck.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"\/en\/card\/04090\">Blue Level Clearance<\/a> truly is fantastic in this deck. It\u2019s both a drawing engine and an economy card. What makes <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04090\">Blue Level Clearance<\/a> great for this deck is its low play cost. As mentioned \u2018Mad Men\u2019 does well even on low credits. With only requiring two credits you can spend one turn with <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04090\">Blue Level Clearance<\/a> and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01110\">Hedge Fund<\/a> to get back to nine credits and replete the cards in HQ.<\/p>\n\n<p>A noticeable absentee to \u2018Mad Men\u2019 is <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04015\">Jackson Howard<\/a>. While a great card to other decks, for this deck he\u2019s just too slow.<\/p>\n\n<p>Economy<\/p>\n\n<p>There are ten economy cards in \u2018Mad Men\u2019. Included are three copies of <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01110\">Hedge Fund<\/a>, three copies of <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04076\">Sweeps Week<\/a>, two copies of <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04034\">Shipment from SanSan<\/a> and two copies of the aforementioned <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04090\">Blue Level Clearance<\/a>. These operation cards have high to very high returns on investment, provide a quick burst economy, and are playable from low levels of credits. The advantage of the burst from low levels is the ability to recover quickly after the use of <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01092\">SanSan City Grid<\/a> and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01059\">Biotic Labor<\/a>, or after being hit by an Account Siphon.<\/p>\n\n<p>The two copies of <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04034\">Shipment from SanSan<\/a> are great in this deck. The Shipment works quite well in a low credits situation, being able to continue the Astrotrain even from zero credits. A great late game card.<\/p>\n\n<p>The type of economy that does not fit within \u2018Mad Men\u2019 is dripping economy, which has a too low return on investment in the short-term. So no asset economy like <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02055\">Marked Accounts<\/a> and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01109\">PAD Campaign<\/a>, no ice economy like <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02056\">Pop-up Window<\/a>. <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04100\">Subliminal Messaging<\/a> also falls into this category, and is excluded for that reason. We need high return on investment on a short-term basis.<\/p>\n\n<p>Other out-off-faction burst economy cards with a low play cost like <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04012\">Celebrity Gift<\/a>, <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01098\">Beanstalk Royalties<\/a>, and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02070\">Green Level Clearance<\/a> are nice, but are inferior to <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04090\">Blue Level Clearance<\/a>. There\u2019s no place for them.<\/p>\n\n<p>Ice<\/p>\n\n<p>Then the ice composition. This deck needs two types of ice. The first type of ice has the purpose to create the window to score the first <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01081\">AstroScript Pilot Program<\/a>. The first AstroScript is either fast advanced directly from HQ or installed in a one to three ice deep remote server. Protecting the AstroScript in the early game is essential. For this purpose we need cheap end-the-run ice. The deck contains eleven pieces of end-the-run ice with a rez cost of three and lower, that\u2019s one quarter of the deck space.<\/p>\n\n<p>Included in the deck are three copies of <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04096\">Wraparound<\/a>, two copies of <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01113\">Wall of Static<\/a>, two copies of <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04120\">Quandary<\/a>, two copies of <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02060\">Chimera<\/a>, and two copies of <a href=\"\/en\/card\/05025\">Rainbow<\/a>. The dedication of one quarter of the deck to cheap end-the-run ice together with its composition is de result of extensive play-testing. This cheap ice protects the <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01081\">AstroScript Pilot Program<\/a> in the early game and enables to open-up a scoring window. This ice is weak against Parasite and Knight, so it\u2019s good to have some back-up available.<\/p>\n\n<p>Do note that these eleven pieces of ice have a high return on investment. For a quite small investment they provide the protection you\u2019ll need for your valuable agendas.<\/p>\n\n<p>There\u2019s some noticeable ice that doesn\u2019t quality for this first purpose. While <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04077\">RSVP<\/a> is nice to protect a <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01092\">SanSan City Grid<\/a> it fails to protect an <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01081\">AstroScript Pilot Program<\/a> well enough. It doesn\u2019t work on HQ and to protect a remote server it\u2019s too dependent on the order you draw your ice. Another piece of ice I failed to appreciate is <a href=\"\/en\/card\/05024\">Guard<\/a>. It\u2019s just too expensive for what it does and there are simply too many Faeries out there.<\/p>\n\n<p>Then there is the second type of ice. After you\u2019ve scored the first <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01081\">AstroScript Pilot Program<\/a> you\u2019ll need to draw or <a href=\"\/en\/card\/05027\">Fast Track<\/a> into the next AstroScripts. At that point the runner will be hitting your R&amp;D and HQ, looking to steal your agendas. To slow the runner down there\u2019s the need for some more taxing ice.<\/p>\n\n<p>Besides being a cheap end-the-run ice <a href=\"\/en\/card\/05025\">Rainbow<\/a> also classifies as taxing ice. For almost all icebreakers it\u2019ll cost the runner more to break than it cost me to rez it. <a href=\"\/en\/card\/05025\">Rainbow<\/a> is a fantastic ice, and will almost always go on one of the central servers. A high return on investment.<\/p>\n\n<p>Furthermore there are two copies of <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04020\">Grim<\/a> and one <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01090\">Tollbooth<\/a>, destined to tax the runner on the central servers. <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04020\">Grim<\/a> is obviously great in front of an end-the-run ice, but also works well as a single ice. Building a remote server and score from it, forces the runner to install programs, I\u2019ll be happy to trash later.<\/p>\n\n<p>One noticeable absentee is <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02110\">Eli 1.0<\/a>. I truly love this taxing ice, but I love spending the influence on <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04090\">Blue Level Clearance<\/a> even more. Alas.<\/p>\n\n<p>During the early game I tend not to rez ice on the central servers. I do need the credits to fast advance the first <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01081\">AstroScript Pilot Program<\/a> or to protect it in a remote server. You must be willing to lose some agenda points during the early game. Be indifferent.

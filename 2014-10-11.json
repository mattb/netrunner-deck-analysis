I created the Matrix. I've been waiting for you. You have many questions, and although the process has altered your consciousness, you remain irrevocably human. Ergo, some of my answers you will understand, and some of them you will not. Concordantly, while your first question may be the most pertinent, you may or may not realize it is also the most irrelevant. <\/p>\n\n<p>The Architect: You are here because Zion is about to be destroyed. Its every living inhabitant terminated, its entire existence eradicated. \nNeo: Bullshit. \n[the monitors respond the same] \nThe Architect: Denial is the most predictable of all human responses. But, rest assured, this will be the sixth time we have destroyed it, and we have become exceedingly efficient at it. <\/p>\n\n<p>The Architect: There are levels of survival we are prepared to accept. However, the relevant issue is whether or not you are ready to accept the responsibility for the death of every human being in this world. <\/p>\n\n<p>Neo: If I were you, I would hope we don't meet again. \nThe Architect: We won't. <\/p>\n\n<p>The Architect: Humph. Hope, it is the quintessential human delusion, simultaneously the source of your greatest strength, and your greatest weakness. <\/p>\n\n<p>The Architect: As I was saying, she stumbled upon a solution whereby nearly ninety-nine percent of the test subjects accepted the program provided they were given a choice - even if they were only aware of it at a near-unconscious level. While this solution worked, it was fundamentally flawed, creating the otherwise contradictory systemic anomaly, that, if left unchecked, might threaten the system itself. Ergo, those who refused the program, while a minority, would constitute an escalating probability of disaster. \nNeo: This is about Zion. <\/p>\n\n<p>The Architect: There are two doors. The door to your right leads to the Source and the salvation of Zion. The door to your left leads back to the Matrix, to her... and to the end of your species. As you adequately put, the problem is choice. But we already know what you are going to do, don't we? Already I can see the chain reaction: the chemical precursors that signal the onset of an emotion, designed specifically to overwhelm logic and reason. An emotion that is already blinding you to the simple and obvious truth: she is going to die and there is nothing you can do to stop it. <\/p>\n\n<p>Neo: Why am I here? \nThe Architect: Your life is the sum of a remainder of an unbalanced equation inherent to the programming of the matrix. You are the eventuality of an anomaly, which despite my sincerest efforts I have been unable to eliminate from what is otherwise a harmony of mathematical precision. While it remains a burden assiduously avoided, it is not unexpected, and thus not beyond a measure of control. Which has led you, inexorably, here. \nNeo: You haven't answered my question. \nThe Architect: Quite right. Interesting. That was quicker than the others. <\/p>\n\n<p>The Architect: The function of the One is now to return to the source, allowing a temporary dissemination of the code you carry, reinserting the prime program. After which you will be required to select from the matrix 23 individuals, 16 female, 7 male, to rebuild Zion. Failure to comply with this process will result in a cataclysmic system crash killing everyone connected to the matrix, which coupled with the extermination of Zion will ultimately result in the extinction of the entire human race. \nNeo: You won't let it happen, you can't. You need human beings to survive. \nThe Architect: There are levels of survival we are prepared to accept. <\/p>\n\n<p>The Architect: The first matrix I designed was quite naturally perfect. It was a work of art. Flawless. Sublime. A triumph only equaled by its monumental failure. <\/p>\n\n<p>The Architect: It is interesting reading your reactions. Your five predecessors were, by design, based on a similar predication: a contingent affirmation that was meant to create a profound attachment to the rest of your species, facilitating the function of the One. While the others experienced this in a general way, your experience is far more specific. Vis-\u00e0-vis: love. \nNeo: Trinity. \n[the monitors show images of Trinity] \nThe Architect: Apropos, she entered the Matrix to save your life at the cost of her own. \nNeo: No... \nThe Architect: Which brings us at last to the moment of truth, wherein the fundamental flaw is ultimately expressed, and the Anomaly revealed as both beginning... and end. <\/p>\n","username":"gumonshoe","cards":{"01059":2,"01064":2,"01081":3,"01082":2,"01090":2,"01092":3,"01109":3,"01110":3,"01111":1,"01113":1,"02055":3,"02056":3,"02110":3,"02115":3,"04015":3,"04076":3,"04096":2,"04119":3,"04120":2,"06005":1,"06061":2}},{"id":9647,"name":"walking-noise-1-3","creation":"2014-10-11 18:24:57","description":"<p>This Noise walks, when I say walks I mean he doesn't run, not that much at least.

(We have built in Indexing protection - with either unrezzed ice on R&amp;D or a <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02060\">Chimera<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n<p>5) Grail ice with this identity is effective because ice in hand are never dead cards. NEXT and Grail together with <a href=\"\/en\/card\/06010\">Mother Goddess<\/a> will be very efficient and effective but is meta dependent.<\/p>\n\n<p>6) This identity naturally protects HQ because it puts extra ice in hand.<\/p>\n\n<p>7) Our identity wants to rez ice, which means the runner needs to run. If the runner tries to just focus one server they can potentially deplete money and then pressure other servers unhindered.  <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02038\">Amazon Industrial Zone<\/a> counters this, allowing the ability to proc on the runner AND corp's turn. It is also a nice economy option and can get an oppressive scoring remote established.<\/p>\n\n<p>8) Punitive Counterstrike are the surprise factor with this build.  If the runner spots it early, it forces them to waste time digging for a plascrete.  Even with a plascrete two Punitive Counterstrikes put money pressure or card pressure on them depending on how the corp bids.<\/p>\n\n<p>Economy: Since this is a Red Coats style deck, and is not HB:EtF,  extra economy cards were added. Sometimes the game state demands the corp \"turtle up\" so aside from installing ice, the economy should be click efficient. <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01056\">Adonis Campaign<\/a> does not require clicks to use and can be initially set up in a scoring server. <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02092\">Eve Campaign<\/a> is usually put out in open remotes.  <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01108\">Melange Mining Corp.<\/a> usually forces the runner to deal with it, which means you will probably rez ice to defend it, which is good.<\/p>\n\n<p>UPGRADES: <\/p>\n\n<p>v2.2 <\/p>\n\n<p>Previous versions with NEXT and Grail ice are very weak to Katman\/Parasite recursion\/Sharpshooter recursion which is very popular nationwide and in our local meta.  I have changed the ice structure, going up to 3 <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01062\">Ichi 1.0<\/a> and adding <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01061\">Heimdall 1.0<\/a> which makes Project Wotan a little more viable. <a href=\"\/en\/card\/03022\">Tyr's Hand<\/a> may be a possible inclusion because of the one shot breakers Sharpshooter and Deus X Shaper players use to get by Ichis and Heimdalls.  The extra <a href=\"\/en\/card\/06010\">Mother Goddess<\/a> is useless so it is taken out.  The sole <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02060\">Chimera<\/a> addition is used exclusively on R&amp;D against Indexing, which is very strong against this deck if it finds the agendas.  This deck constantly has 5 or 6 cards in hand which makes <a href=\"\/en\/card\/06041\">IQ<\/a> a potentially powerful inclusion.  It is efficient for rez cost vs strength and a Tennin Institute deck in our meta has resounding success with <a href=\"\/en\/card\/06041\">IQ<\/a>. Finally, <a href=\"\/en\/card\/05016\">Inazuma<\/a>s are very powerful with <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01062\">Ichi 1.0<\/a>s floating around. An unbroken <a href=\"\/en\/card\/05016\">Inazuma<\/a> into a <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01061\">Heimdall 1.0<\/a> is also very rude.<\/p>\n","username":"IronRaven88","cards":{"01056":3,"01061":2,"01062":3,"01106":3,"01108":2,"01110":3,"02013":2,"02038":2,"02039":1,"02060":1,"02070":3,"02092":2,"03006":2,"04011":3,"04079":3,"04090":2,"05016":2,"06001":2,"06002":3,"06010":1,"06021":1,"06030":1,"06041":3}},{"id":9654,"name":"Noise doesn't like Blue!","creation":"2014-10-11 20:45:50","description":"<p>Had to re-build this after netrunnerdb.ca redirects here.<\/p>\n\n<p>Anyways this is my updated Noise deck after the release of Up and Over.

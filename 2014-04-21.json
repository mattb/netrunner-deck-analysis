I found it interesting how people were keen to run face down remotes early and after they see 2 PADs they start ignoring them so it served as a hiding spot for agendas when I got agenda flooded or when they started trying to hit HQ.<\/p>\n\n<p>Low agenda density kept runners wasting time hammering RnD, except for the one occasion on the final game where a Gabe runner hit RnD 3 times and got all the points he needed.

This deck is custom built for that type of playstyle. Run early, run alot. Have the corp in it's toes, and eventually build up your rig and start digging.<\/p>\n\n<h1>The Cards<\/h1>\n\n<p>Many cards speak for themselves, but I will focus on some of the core mechanics and their cards.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Account Siphon and Indexing<\/h2>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>These are the best cards to get early, I almost always keep my   hand if I find both in my starting hand.  Both cards puts high pressure on the corp. I usually start with a run on HQ, if rez, I index R&amp;D, if the other way around, I Siphon their accounts. Some rush decks will stop both, centrals, but then you know early what kind of deck you are up against. A rule of thumb is to always Account Siphon on your second click, so you can remove the tags.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<h2>Self-modifying Code and Clone Chip<\/h2>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>This combo has seen many plays before, so I am certain you are familiar with the tactic. Face check with SMC so that you can pull out any breaker you want (keep yourself over 5 credits, preferably around 10). Deus Ex gets rid of all the ice that hurts you (net and brain damage) and Sharpshooter prevents your precious programs from getting trashed.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<h2>Ice Breakers<\/h2>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Corroder is an auto include, not much to say there. Zu.13 is just really cheap and easy to pull with SMC. Femme Fatale is a real pain in the ass to hard install (paying full price), but her bypass have always paid out. Use Clone Chip to retrieve SMC (like mid-run even) or any of your ice-breakers.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<h1>Strategy<\/h1>\n\n<p>Run on your first click, if you get beaten up fine, nothing can kill you in the first turn. If you run into a neural katana, just jack out and draw some cards. As the game progresses, use the standard rule of thumb: Remotes -> HQ -> R&amp;D -> Archives. But if you can, pressure the centrals with Siphon and Indexing. This locks down R&amp;D (that is what this deck does best) and keeping the corp poor (and you filthy rich).<\/p>\n\n<h4>Good luck and have fun!<\/h4>\n","username":"Oathwood","cards":{"01007":1,"01018":3,"01026":1,"01034":3,"01036":2,"01050":3,"01053":3,"02007":1,"02009":3,"02046":1,"02066":1,"02091":3,"02106":3,"02107":2,"03035":1,"03038":3,"03046":3,"03054":3,"04067":1}},{"id":4424,"name":"Helsinki Chronos Protocol 2nd place Corp Deck","creation":"2014-04-21 16:07:37","description":"<p>This is the deck I used at the Helsinki Chronos Protocol Tour on 20th of April 2014.

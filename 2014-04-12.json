Darwin is the core breaker, with Surge to get it moving a little quicker. Another fun trick is to surge Chakana to make it immediately active. Same Ol' Things are there to recycle Surges. The major economy is Magnum Opus, with Cyberfeeders as back up and Modded to help get things into play faster. Definitely looking for any suggestions on how to improve this build\/concept. Seems like an interesting direction. I like the idea of Surging Chakanas to keep the Corp from getting agendas moving.

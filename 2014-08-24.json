You are looking for at least two of: <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01109\">PAD Campaign<\/a>, <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02055\">Marked Accounts<\/a>, <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02056\">Pop-up Window<\/a> or <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04015\">Jackson Howard<\/a>, and not too many agendas. Due to the draw ability, bad starting hands are somewhat mitigated.<\/li>\n<li>Use the ID ability every turn if able. There are 31 cards in the deck that can be installed facedown in a new remote, so this shouldn't be difficult.<\/li>\n<li>Ice is almost exclusively for central servers. If you think you have a window for it, you can try and score an <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01081\">AstroScript Pilot Program<\/a> behind a <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01090\">Tollbooth<\/a>, but <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01090\">Tollbooth<\/a> is usually best spent protecting your most heavily attacked central server.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"\/en\/card\/04055\">City Surveillance<\/a> strategy: this card is an MVP in this deck. Almost noone will trash them when they're unrezzed, especially if you have a few <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02029\">Encryption Protocol<\/a>s running. Place them face down, and then wait until the runner ends their turn with 1 or 2 credits, then rez as many as you can, even if it bankrupts you. This gives them the option of floating tags (which is what we really want), or spending a lot of turns getting the money to trash them while remaining tag-free, only to have you re-install them with <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04060\">Interns<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"\/en\/card\/02118\">Dedicated Response Team<\/a> strategy: try and hide their presence for as long as possible, only rezzing them when they commit to accessing a <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01070\">Snare!<\/a> or <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04075\">TGTBT<\/a>. The other time to start rezzing them is if they start floating tags. Either way, they're going to be trashing them aggressively after that, so either protect them with light ice, or <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04060\">Interns<\/a> them back for maximum frustration. Once they start floating tags, <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02118\">Dedicated Response Team<\/a> taxes every run with meat damage, and slows them down <em>a lot<\/em>.<\/li>\n<li>Avoid HQ agenda flood at all costs. I don't mind holding onto 1 or 2 <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04119\">NAPD Contract<\/a>s or an <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01081\">AstroScript Pilot Program<\/a> that I think I'll be scoring soon, but otherwise they need to be chucked in the archives once you have a <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04015\">Jackson Howard<\/a> on the table.<\/li>\n<li>I inevitably need to devote a section to countering Account Siphon: try to keep enough assets on the table that you can rez, then hit them with <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01084\">Closed Accounts<\/a> as soon as possible. Keeping unrezzed <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02118\">Dedicated Response Team<\/a>s can also wreck an unprepared siphoner. This deck isn't too badly affected by siphon play, and can destroy a runner that decides to float tags. <\/li>\n<li>There are a thousand mind games you can play with this card composition. Things like: install\/advance a <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04075\">TGTBT<\/a>, making it look like an NAPD, then they take the tag when they run. I'll often leave <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01081\">AstroScript Pilot Program<\/a> facedown unadvanced for a few turns if they're not checking remotes and I have other priorities for my clicks at the time.<\/li>\n<li>As of writing this, Astrobiotics NEH is by far the most popular build. The runner may play in anticipation of this, meaning that you may be able to get kills when they are rushing and are careless.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<h2>Weaknesses<\/h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Whizzard. This matchup can still work out, you just need to install faster than he can trash with his recurring credits. Manually draw if needed to supplement your ID draw for new assets.<\/li>\n<li>Ignoring your assets, and keeping pressure on centrals. If they have the econ to continually ignore the city surveillance tax and can enough to <em>also<\/em> hit your central servers, then your remotes are pretty worthless. Aim to get difficult ice like <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01090\">Tollbooth<\/a> and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01088\">Data Raven<\/a> rezzed on your key centrals.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<h2>Potential Adjustments and Alterations<\/h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"\/en\/card\/05026\">Diversified Portfolio<\/a> could work really well; I usually have 5+ remotes early on in the game.<\/li>\n<li>Add a few more ice. I've tried a few different iterations of the deck with more, and some with less. Around 10 seems enough to tax your centrals sufficiently.<\/li>\n<li>More consistent ice. With lots of 1\/2 ofs, Your ice composition will be different every game. Counterargument: allows unpredictability, mitigated by deck's draw power, allows multiple games against an opponent without them knowing what your ice will be.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<h2>Additional Notes<\/h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>I've been playing around with <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02118\">Dedicated Response Team<\/a> for a fair while, so I'm glad that an ID finally came out that makes it great!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","username":"Toomin","cards":{"01070":2,"01081":3,"01084":2,"01085":1,"01088":1,"01090":1,"01109":3,"01110":3,"02029":3,"02055":2,"02056":3,"02110":1,"02115":3,"02118":3,"04015":3,"04055":3,"04060":3,"04075":2,"04096":1,"04119":3,"05025":2,"06005":1,"06027":1}},{"id":8917,"name":"Sneaky Anthony ","creation":"2014-08-24 20:46:05","description":"\n","username":"willequalsftw","cards":{"01007":1,"01018":2,"01020":1,"01021":2,"01022":3,"01026":1,"01027":1,"01028":1,"01036":1,"01050":3,"02007":1,"02009":2,"02043":1,"02064":1,"02085":1,"02091":1,"02104":3,"03035":1,"03052":3,"03054":3,"04029":3,"04109":3,"05030":1,"05035":1}},{"id":8918,"name":"Researching Chaos (In-Depth Look)","creation":"2014-08-24 21:28:04","description":"<p>If you are interested in the In-Depth look, I gladly point you to my article on teamcovenant.com<\/p>\n\n<p>http:\/\/teamcovenant.com\/jawz\/2014\/08\/25\/researching-chaos-theory-in-depth-look\/<\/p>\n","username":"jawZ","cards":{"01007":1,"01012":1,"01018":1,"01026":1,"01034":3,"01036":2,"01043":1,"01044":2,"01050":3,"02009":1,"02046":1,"02047":3,"02066":1,"02087":1,"02106":1,"03034":3,"03035":1,"03038":2,"03046":3,"03053":2,"03054":3,"04067":1,"05035":1,"05036":2}},{"id":8919,"name":"Seeker 1.1","creation":"2014-08-24 21:40:52","description":"\n","username":"wery67564","cards":{"01007":1,"01008":3,"01012":3,"01014":1,"01026":1,"01027":1,"01034":3,"01035":3,"01036":3,"01044":1,"01050":3,"02046":1,"02067":3,"02087":3,"03035":1,"03038":3,"03046":3,"04086":3,"04108":1}},{"id":8920,"name":"Experimental NEH Astrobiotics","creation":"2014-08-24 23:00:37","description":"<p>Experimental components- \nInterns.\nRainbow.\nRSVP.<\/p>\n","username":"siowy","cards":{"01059":3,"01064":2,"01081":3,"01082":2,"01092":3,"01109":3,"01110":3,"01111":1,"01113":1,"02056":3,"02110":3,"02115":3,"04015":3,"04020":1,"04060":1,"04076":3,"04077":1,"04096":2,"04119":3,"04120":1,"05025":1,"05027":3,"06005":1}}]

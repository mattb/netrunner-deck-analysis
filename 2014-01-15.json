The idea is to get a MO out then get a garrote on dinosaurus, a torch and a Corroder and run. Keyhole is mostly for jinteki and opening hand draws against undefended servers. Deus X (and clone chips) and net shield for the jinteki matchup as well. e3 because HB and I want to make sure I draw it if I need it. I'm debating dropping the net shield and a deus X for 2 Atman. Atman has worked well for me in general but it's never been a staple icebreaker, more situational and early threat uses. I still think the deus x and net shield are a solid investment even if I don't use them every game. They're going to be so strong against jinteki (and the occasional AP ICE) they're worth the slots. I'm thinking I can go tag me, but psychographics is a thing so I'm debating -1 stimhack, -1 e3, -1?, for +3 Lawyer up for even more card draw and a way to clear tags when I'm trying to run through data ravens but not let them psychographics.\nThoughts?

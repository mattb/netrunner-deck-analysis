This allows me to go TagMe with the Siphon recursion to cripple the Corp's economy or just credit up. <em>NB:<\/em> there is no room for <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01051\">Crypsis<\/a> if the full central-only Rig is up; this is deliberate but sometimes can lead to hard choices to trash Passport to make room for the AI breaker if a remote run is utterly necessary.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"\/en\/card\/05038\">Public Terminal<\/a> was in the original version of the build but dropped to make room for Dirty Laundry to come back in after I'd dropped that to make space for something else. Indexing is a star performer, and can win games. Running Interference is less of a hit to the economy if you're able to get a Prepaid or two down, and get credits back with Ken. It makes an excellent surprise run at remotes when the Corp is planning to rush behind a costly piece of Ice; Archer could wreck the rig and put you out of the game, but not when it costs 8 to rez in phase 1 when the Corp can be kept poor by taxing runs.<\/p>\n\n<p>Legwork and Maker's Eye can also bring surprise wins, and the latter is sometimes an unexpected splash that catches the Corp napping vs Criminals' traditional HQ focus. TME didn't do much damage at my Regionals, but the threat was useful.<\/p>\n\n<p>The deck can be on match point on four agenda points, if all the stars align. To pull this off you need all the central breakers to be assured of making the runs successful. Early Bird into, typically, Archives and Doppelganger run at R&amp;D. Feint (typically) or just break into HQ normally on click 2, and play out the three Notoriety on clicks 3, 4, and 5 for the win. I've managed double Notoriety wins from 5 points more often than you'd think likely. I like to hoard the second or third Early Bird to enable this, so don't drop it early if you're looking for the Notoriety win.<\/p>\n\n<p>Play wise, early on I run like an Anarch; no rig and low cash. Those early phase one runs can net valuable a.p. which bring you towards that match point for Notoriety to close out the game. There's only one copy of each breaker and two Magnums, so being prepared to draw manually to hit one of the three Quality Times is important. That said, try to exploit as many of the <em>run<\/em> events that come up, and pressure the remotes if possible.<\/p>\n\n<p>The deck is fun to play, and I enjoyed success against NBN MN, GRNDL Division, HB EtF, and I think it has good game vs Jinteki RP and Tennin. Against Jinteki PE I think the strategy is the same as any Runner, draw up madly and go for it, but hitting Siphon to turn off their traps is also very strong play. I've not had a chance to play this vs HB CI but think that combining Breach, Alias, Magum and Siphon with the Legworks should be strong against that archetype as well.

The original build had two Tyrants but they are too situational to really merit inclusion. I should have dropped the second for a Hive, say, but then the deck name would be meaningless, so I kept it. ;-)<\/p>\n\n<p>There's some cute tricks such as <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01089\">Matrix Analyzer<\/a> and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/05021\">Neotokyo Grid<\/a> to get free advances mid-run (spend and get the refund from NtG). If the Runner is seeing you benefit from this too much (Trick-able counters, Tyrant building up to Hive level subs) then they may choose to avoid the server altogether. Otherwise it can help steer them away from otherwise vulnerable central servers that are being hit to prevent the free advance from your Identity ability, because you're getting a click-free advance anyway.<\/p>\n\n<p>Aiming for taxing Ice with Tollbooth, Wall of Thorns, Ichi 1.0 (I'm finally a convert, @Ber), and Susanoo-No-Mikoto, Cell Portal and Inazuma to make life painful if there isn't a Decoder installed. <\/p>\n\n<p>Cash can be tight with only eight Op economy and two <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01108\">MMC<\/a> for credits but going remote with PAD Campaign or Mental Health Clinic assets turns off the identity's ability if the Runner just runs these remotes and Bank Job is a possibility as well. If you can stick to the game plan and Ice only the three centrals and one well defended agenda scoring server then the MMC can help to pay for the high cost Ice you're trying to rez. I found in the tournament that the Successful Demonstrations were perhaps the weakest inclusion economically, as when you're getting run through and need to rez just to cost the Runner credits or 'sucker tokens, the much needed payout isn't coming. It feels like a 'win more' card in this deck; when you're on top of the game then the bonus credits from SD are great, when you're struggling to get back into the game something else is required.<\/p>\n\n<p>Surprisingly I found that <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04015\">Jackson Howard<\/a> wasn't really missed. I did get stuck with one hand of three Agenda in one game, but was losing already so that wasn't the issue, and Jackson wouldn't likely have been the difference maker.<\/p>\n\n<p>The Agenda suite is designed to support \/  be synergistic with the ability, with both <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01068\">Nisei MK II<\/a> and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04053\">Unorthodox Predictions<\/a> potentially buying you another shot at the free advance, which can lend you more <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02033\">Trick of Light<\/a> counters or possibly just clicking along an installed Agenda chained with the Unorthodox score. To make room for the Ice and econ, this runs an atypically low number of Ambush cards, but a mid-game Secretary or Junebug can set the runner back enough turns to move to match point and secure the servers enough to make it your game.<\/p>\n\n<p>A late change to the deck swapped out two <a href=\"\/en\/card\/05025\">Rainbow<\/a> for the Swordsmen which was an invaluable change (thanks to @kage02 &amp; @Ber for the testing and advice there).<\/p>\n\n<p>The deck has proven to be surprisingly resilient, coming back from Siphons and early agenda bleeds to be able to win. The free advance is an incredible ability if you can play to it, which is what the design is trying to enable as much as possible. The one really devastating archetype that seems to have its number is Kate Parasite recursion, which ran all over me twice (once in Swiss, once in the double elims and probably would have a third time if we'd had to go to that game). This might suggest that it is also weak to Andy with static breakers and Datasuckers, but that bears testing. Her star is fading these days anyway, and i didn't face one all day.<\/p>\n\n<p>Hope you like it!<\/p>\n","username":"ODie","cards":{"01057":1,"01062":1,"01068":3,"01069":1,"01070":1,"01074":1,"01078":2,"01089":2,"01090":1,"01103":1,"01108":2,"01110":2,"02033":2,"02078":1,"03014":2,"03027":1,"04012":2,"04013":2,"04033":2,"04053":2,"04073":2,"04074":2,"04100":2,"04115":1,"05003":1,"05005":3,"05007":2,"05016":2,"05020":1,"05021":2}},{"id":6862,"name":"HQ and Slash","creation":"2014-06-16 20:55:19","description":"\n","username":"kfc_avenger","cards":{"01009":2,"01017":1,"01018":2,"01024":1,"01030":3,"02026":3,"02041":3,"02043":3,"02084":2,"02085":3,"02086":3,"03049":1,"04063":3,"04065":2,"05034":2,"05035":3,"05038":2,"05042":2,"05046":2,"05048":3}},{"id":6864,"name":"Chaos Turbo Rig II","creation":"2014-06-16 21:17:39","description":"\n","username":"daytodave","cards":{"01007":1,"01010":1,"01026":1,"01034":3,"01038":2,"01044":1,"01050":3,"02003":3,"02046":1,"02047":3,"02048":3,"02106":3,"03034":3,"03035":1,"03038":2,"03046":3,"03049":3,"03053":3,"04047":1}},{"id":6865,"name":"Prepaid Kate","creation":"2014-06-16 21:37:53","description":"\n","username":"arribous","cards":{"01007":1,"01033":1,"01034":3,"01036":3,"01043":1,"01050":3,"02009":2,"02047":2,"02066":1,"02087":2,"03034":2,"03035":1,"03038":3,"03046":3,"03052":3,"03053":3,"03054":1,"04029":3,"04065":1,"04067":1,"04086":1,"04109":3,"05035":2}},{"id":6866,"name":"Prepaid Kate","creation":"2014-06-16 21:48:42","description":"\n","username":"arribous","cards":{"01004":1,"01007":1,"01026":1,"01033":1,"01034":3,"01036":3,"01038":3,"01050":3,"02009":2,"02047":2,"02066":1,"02087":2,"03034":2,"03035":1,"03038":1,"03046":2,"03052":3,"03053":3,"03054":1,"04029":3,"04047":1,"04065":1,"04067":1,"04109":3,"05035":1}},{"id":6867,"name":"Prepaid Kate","creation":"2014-06-16 22:00:42","description":"\n","username":"arribous","cards":{"01007":1,"01012":1,"01026":1,"01033":1,"01034":3,"01036":3,"01050":3,"02009":2,"02047":3,"02048":2,"02066":1,"02087":2,"03034":2,"03035":1,"03038":1,"03046":2,"03052":3,"03053":3,"03054":1,"04029":3,"04047":1,"04067":1,"04109":3,"05035":2}},{"id":6868,"name":"Prepaid Katman","creation":"2014-06-16 22:12:05","description":"\n","username":"arribous","cards":{"01008":2,"01012":2,"01026":1,"01033":1,"01034":3,"01036":3,"01050":3,"02009":2,"02047":2,"02066":1,"02087":2,"03035":1,"03038":2,"03040":2,"03046":2,"03048":1,"03052":3,"03053":3,"03054":1,"04029":3,"04067":1,"04086":1,"04109":3,"05035":1}},{"id":6869,"name":"Director Upgrades","creation":"2014-06-16 22:23:18","description":"<p>I so want to make Director Haas and Mandatory Upgrades work.

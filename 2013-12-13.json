Forcing the runner to shake tags or accumulate for your psychographics score is win\/win for you. I also went with 3\/2 agendas for never advance. With 12 assets, your opponent never knows if it's an agenda or another campaign\/JackHo. I lose the PSF\/EFF Comm combo but I (or you) can always switch out -3 agendas (one each of mandatory upgrades, project vitruvious, ABT) for +3 PSF if you want it.  Play tested Wednesday against local players and went 4\/5. 80% win rate is pretty awesome. Local players were playtesting decks but all were solid builds and the players were strong, no gimmes.

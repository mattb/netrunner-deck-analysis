Here is my first attempt at creating a Professor decklist. Keep in mind I am newer to Android: Netrunner but highly competitive so I have done a good chunk of my homework (I think) in terms of a good approach to this style of deck. Also, I only have cards up to Creation &amp; Control so will update this as I buy the 2nd cycle and big expansion (the main idea is still there in the list though). I welcome any criticism and pretty much encourage it especially if you play this game a lot. <\/p>\n\n<p>The general overall strategy behind the deck is two-fold. During the early phase, I want to run as much early as possible being able to pull out cheap breakers to get through successfully as much as I can. I plan to use cards like Clone Chip and Self Modifying Code to pull out what I need on the fly if I don't manage to draw into it first. After ice is rezzed and established, the later portion of the game involves moving into a rig relying more on Atmans and Datasuckers to do much of the breaking supplemented by viruses and programs to do as much economic damage as possible along the way. <\/p>\n\n<p>Regarding the deck economics, the primary resource is Professional Contacts with the other credit and card drawing cards to supplement the deck as necessary. Modded is pocketed mainly for Atman and Femme Fatale if playing from hand. 3 copies of Scavenge is primarily there to be able to reuse cards like Parasite, Imp, Crescentus, Deus X etc. <\/p>\n\n<p>That's it for my first deck post. Any comments or critiques is more than welcomed and I appreciate your time in reading this fairly long post. Thank you!<\/p>\n","username":"jairoe03","cards":{"01007":1,"01008":2,"01009":1,"01010":1,"01012":1,"01026":1,"01028":1,"01035":1,"01038":3,"01050":3,"02003":1,"02041":1,"02065":1,"02066":1,"02087":3,"02104":1,"03029":1,"03034":3,"03035":1,"03038":3,"03040":2,"03044":1,"03046":3,"03049":3,"03051":2,"03053":3,"04003":1}},{"id":7383,"name":"Sashimi-tini over Crushed Ice","creation":"2014-07-05 07:44:37","description":"<p>A girl with a grudge against ice.

I wanted to see how best to utilize Blue Sun's ability; one thing that stood out was the ability to prolong and actually benefit from asset economy; Private Contracts and Eve Campaign seemed the best candidates. Once they're on their last 2 credits, you can send them back to HQ, offsetting their initial cost and possibly allowing you to reap their benefits again if needed.<\/p>\n\n<p>I figured an excellent way to make some early econ is through Oversight AI + Curtain Wall \/ Janus. Not only are you guaranteed protection on the selected server that turn, but next turn (or really, when you need it), you're also guaranteed a tremendous burst of econ, akin to slapping the runner with a glove.<\/p>\n\n<p>Use your wealth to set up Off the Grid on a remote (possibly one with a vulnerable Eve or PC), toss Ruhr Valley into HQ (along with a Corporate Troubleshooter or two!), and prepare to score your way to victory. Agendas are selected for efficiency. Project Atlas is quick to score (and can provide recursion if you have no other agendas to score soon after). NAPD's the go-to agenda, as usual. Priority Requisition can help secure an Archer on HQ (or other large ice) to increase your protection. Hades Fragment sounds cool, okay?<\/p>\n\n<p>Ice were handpicked by the darkest of executives with the goal of securing that Oversight \/ Blue Sun benefit, and protecting HQ from intrusion. What's great about this setup is that it provides flexibility, and protection from a few runner assaults. Picked up a nasty Parasite? Return to HQ. Femme getting too comfortable? Return to HQ.

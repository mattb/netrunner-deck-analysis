This card is amazing with the hardware in this rig as it is all pretty much free if you are willing to wait one turn, which usually is fine as all the hardware is used to support the AI. Secondly PW can make AI programs super convenient when face checking to avoid early destroyers, or Swordsman and only pull them out when needed (or just to get a free knight). If\/when these ICE rear their ugly heads mimic and sharpshooter can be called up or cloned to take them out, and don't take away from free chip space needed for Overmind. As a final note PW also lets you slowly work off Overmind while allocating money towards more MU chips or LLDS chips.<\/p>\n\n<p>I also decided to add in three LLDS processors which, for the first time that I have ever seen, really shine in this deck and save a lot of money when paired with Overmind. Test running, clone chipping, or installing Overmind off of PW gives it a lot more flexibility and LLDS boosts it enough to cover all of the lower strength ICE that this card is meant to break. Similarly LLDS is useful with Knight which really only comes out for the big strength ICE and doesn't tend to last very long anyway so knights regularly pop in and out of archive for draws and LLDS boosts. <\/p>\n\n<p>I've been super happy with these changes and made one of my first Exile decks which I think is pretty damn strong. The pacing is really fun and I find that once things get going the steady income of Armitage lets me run once each turn with impunity. I also enjoy the theme of having Exile build his entire rig for next to nothing, which this deck does well. The econ can take a bit of juggling to fit, but once you get it this deck is really scary for a lot of corps, especially those that play a shell game.<\/p>\n","username":"Josh9000","cards":{"01011":1,"01034":3,"01038":3,"01050":3,"01053":3,"02047":3,"02049":3,"02091":2,"03030":1,"03034":3,"03038":3,"04002":3,"04022":2,"04042":3,"04043":3,"04066":3,"04067":1,"05053":3}},{"id":6204,"name":"The Hipster Chessmaster","creation":"2014-05-29 09:59:37","description":"\n","username":"Monstermontz","cards":{"01026":2,"01049":3,"01050":3,"02047":3,"02091":3,"02107":3,"03030":1,"03031":1,"03034":3,"03038":3,"03048":1,"03049":3,"03054":3,"04002":3,"04022":3,"04042":3,"04043":2,"05053":3}},{"id":6205,"name":"Official Honnor and Profit Runner Deck","creation":"2014-05-29 10:39:13","description":"<p>To be able to find this deck again in the future.<\/p>\n","username":"LowMemory","cards":{"05028":1,"05031":3,"05032":2,"05033":3,"05034":2,"05035":3,"05037":1,"05038":2,"05039":1,"05041":2,"05042":2,"05043":2,"05044":3,"05045":3,"05046":2,"05047":2,"05048":2,"05049":1,"05050":3,"05051":1,"05052":3,"05054":1,"05055":1}},{"id":6206,"name":"Prepaid Event Toolbox","creation":"2014-05-29 10:52:45","description":"<p>Ok I know what you might be thinking....

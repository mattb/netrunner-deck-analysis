Keep in mind I haven't acquired much experience in playing A:NR, but decided this was the Runner ID I wanted to focus on due to the uniqueness and versatility of the ID. I believe this suits me the best. <\/p>\n\n<p>Main Idea: \nI read in many different articles and forums regarding the Professor that his biggest weaknesses are memory and economy so I sought to build around ensuring a stronger economic foundation while minimizing memory usage as much as possible. <\/p>\n\n<p>Icebreakers were picked to be as minimalist as possible and mostly being able to work in conjunction with <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01008\">Datasucker<\/a> and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01012\">Parasite<\/a>. <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01026\">Femme Fatale<\/a> doubles up as big ice shutdown and primary sentry breaker (keeping <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01008\">Datasucker<\/a> in mind) with <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02104\">Faerie<\/a> playing as backup. All of my breakers all only use 1 MU and is a big reason why I opted not to use heavier breakers like <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02004\">Morning Star<\/a> and to try to keep what I use light. <\/p>\n\n<p>Programs follow a very similar trend with many other Professor decklists, I'll focus on the cards that might differ. I run 2 copies of <a href=\"\/en\/card\/03047\">Sahasrara<\/a> expecting to install from stack or heap a lot. Multiple copies in hopes of being able to draw into it more often than having to tutor for it. <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02065\">Crescentus<\/a> leads back to winning the overall economic battle against the corporation with an expectation of being able to break most ice at any given time.  Also note that all of my programs are mostly 1 MU  programs save <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01028\">Sneakdoor Beta<\/a> and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/03046\">Self-modifying Code<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>Regarding events <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02087\">Quality Time<\/a> is used to push my deck along especially in cases where I don't get <a href=\"\/en\/card\/03049\">Professional Contacts<\/a> early and also helps me get to what I need without an solely relying on <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02047\">Test Run<\/a> or <a href=\"\/en\/card\/03046\">Self-modifying Code<\/a>. <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02047\">Test Run<\/a> and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/03034\">Scavenge<\/a> are fairly standard. Everything else helps boost my economy.<\/p>\n\n<p>Regarding hardware, the primary thing to note is <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01041\">The Toolbox<\/a> and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02028\">Dyson Mem Chip<\/a>. This helps increase my MU capabilities and allows me to be hard to trace. This is my \"solution\" to not have to include <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02009\">Plascrete Carapace<\/a> while being able to include more MU. The idea is to be economic enough to be able to avoid most tags. <\/p>\n\n<p>Resources is the heart of my economy (and most other runner's) relying mostly on <a href=\"\/en\/card\/03049\">Professional Contacts<\/a> which is supplemented by <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01047\">Aesop's Pawnshop<\/a>. I expect the programs swaps is going to necessitate trashing a good amount of programs so why not make some credits while doing it (and not requiring clicks ala <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02091\">Kati Jones<\/a>). <a href=\"\/en\/card\/03054\">Same Old Thing<\/a> is mostly there to back-up <a href=\"\/en\/card\/03035\">Levy AR Lab Access<\/a> in case it gets trashed. This way I have a backup plan to be able to access it if I ever need to run through my deck again. <\/p>\n\n<p>Thank you for reading up to this point if you get here.

I still would like to see a lot of cards that I was not able to fit in the deck (clone chip, I miss you!).<\/p>\n\n<p>First of all, Nasir needs his Personal Workshop. No doubt about it. He needs it so bad you should always mulligan for it. It is the key card to fully use Nasir's ability - you want to pump on it all of your money after the corp rezzes a piece of ice but before you encounter it.<\/p>\n\n<p>3x Diesel and 2x Quality Time - they are here to find you the Personal Workshop if you were not lucky enough to have it in your opening hand. If you have already played it they work well thanks to finding programs and hardware you can play on the Workshop.<\/p>\n\n<p>Economy - Nasir's ability + Armitage Codebusting is often all the econ you need. Kati is great in here as you can store credits on her and take them when everything is already rezed. There is also a ton of economy in recurring credits (Toolbox, Cyberfeeders, Silencer, Cloaks) which will be used during runs once the corp rezzes a new piece of ice.<\/p>\n\n<p>The Toolbox - he ideal console for Nasir - it provides both recurring credits which are essential to get past ice once the corp rezzes anything and also gives me two memory which I also need a lot due to tons of programs I want in play.<\/p>\n\n<p>Multi-access - Interfaces work great here thanks to the synergy with Personal Workshop.<\/p>\n\n<p>Tricks - I picked Test Run + Scavenge over SMC + Stimhack for two reasons - Scavenge is great for abusing Femme and the Stimhacks usually are needed get stuff quickly off the Workshop and I rarely used it on SMC.<\/p>\n\n<p>Icebreakers - Gordian's Blade and Battering Ram are here because you can abuse Nasir's ability and pump their strength after the rez but before losing credits. Dagger is the main sentry breaker with a supporting femme to deal with stuff like Tollbooth. Atman is a back up, against a lot of decks it turns out to be a MVP.<\/p>\n\n<p>I love to play Nasir but I still think that he is a bit unstable, you are really relying on a not unlucky draw at the start of the game (you need to have quickly a Workshop and something big to put on it).

Keep in mind I haven't acquired much experience in playing A:NR, but decided this was the Runner ID I wanted to focus on due to the uniqueness and versatility of the ID. I believe this suits me the best. <\/p>\n\n<p>Main Idea: \nI read in many different articles and forums regarding the Professor that his biggest weaknesses are memory and economy so I sought to build around ensuring a stronger economic foundation while minimizing memory usage as much as possible. <\/p>\n\n<p>Icebreakers were picked to be as minimalist as possible and mostly being able to work in conjunction with <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01008\">Datasucker<\/a> and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01012\">Parasite<\/a>. <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01026\">Femme Fatale<\/a> doubles up as big ice shutdown and primary sentry breaker (keeping <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01008\">Datasucker<\/a> in mind) with <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02104\">Faerie<\/a> playing as backup. All of my breakers all only use 1 MU and is a big reason why I opted not to use heavier breakers like <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02004\">Morning Star<\/a> and to try to keep what I use light. <\/p>\n\n<p>Programs follow a very similar trend with many other Professor decklists, I'll focus on the cards that might differ. <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02065\">Crescentus<\/a> leads back to winning the overall economic battle against the corporation with an expectation of being able to break most ice at any given time.  Also note that all of my programs are mostly 1 MU  programs save <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01028\">Sneakdoor Beta<\/a> and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/03046\">Self-modifying Code<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>Regarding events <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02087\">Quality Time<\/a> is used to push my deck along especially in cases where I don't get <a href=\"\/en\/card\/03049\">Professional Contacts<\/a> early and also helps me get to what I need without an solely relying on <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02047\">Test Run<\/a> or <a href=\"\/en\/card\/03046\">Self-modifying Code<\/a>. <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02047\">Test Run<\/a> and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/03034\">Scavenge<\/a> are fairly standard. Everything else helps boost my economy.<\/p>\n\n<p>Regarding hardware, the primary thing to note is <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01041\">The Toolbox<\/a> and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02028\">Dyson Mem Chip<\/a>. This helps increase my MU capabilities and allows me to be hard to trace. This is my \"solution\" to not have to include <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02009\">Plascrete Carapace<\/a> while being able to include more MU. The idea is to be economic enough to be able to avoid most tags. <\/p>\n\n<p>Resources is the heart of my economy (and most other runner's) relying mostly on <a href=\"\/en\/card\/03049\">Professional Contacts<\/a> which is supplemented by <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02049\">Personal Workshop<\/a> and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/03053\">Daily Casts<\/a>.

I've dabbled in other Anarchs but I mostly stick with Noise. In other factions, I really liked an Katman deck I had shortly after Creation and Control came out. One of my favorite things about that deck is how it rewarded you for running. With Datasuckers, Desperado, John Masanori and the ease of getting in with Atman and Self-Modifying code, it was so efficient. I've also really wanted to make a deck where Hemorrhage worked. I was underwhelmed when I first saw it and unimpressed when I tested it. But I knew there was something good there.<\/p>\n\n<p>With this in mind, I started making this deck. It's gone through a few revisions (mostly in the influence, but it was originally a Whizzard deck) but I'm pretty happy where it is now. With at least two Hemorrhages in play, the deck starts ripping apart the corps hand. They'll try to lock you out. The Knights get you in. They try to draw cards to fix the problem, Gorman Drip v1 gives you credits. John Masanori gets you cards. Security Testing gets you credits. Imp and Keyhole destroy other corp cards. The goal is to keep running.<\/p>\n\n<p>I never used to use Djinn's tutor ability, but the faster you get out 2-3 Hemorrhages the better. Getting those Datasuckers out is just icing on the cake.<\/p>\n\n<p>I'd say the deck does very well against all the popular Archtypes right now. Anything that requires a combo (Cerebral Imaging or Scorch Decks) won't be able to hold onto the pieces. Fast Advance decks have to choose between their Agendas or their FA pieces (almost always choosing the FA pieces, leaving their hand full of agendas). I've found the hardest deck to play against is Replicating Perfection as they will make you waste a lot of clicks.<\/p>\n\n<p>Overall, I'd say I was surprised by how well this deck performed. It started as more of a joke or \"what-if?\" type of deck but it's been very successful on OCTGN with many great comments such as:<\/p>\n\n<p>\"Wow, that deck is bull.

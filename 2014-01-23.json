Inspired by andromeda builds that say \"efficient  breakers, and money for the rest of the slots\"  Who does it better than shaper?<\/p>\n\n<p>Essentially every slot is cash or utilizing cash.  Liberated looks like a wonky splash, but like in anarch with armitage, it works well with magnum opus surging you beyond 16 credits in a turn.  I do tend to use it when I'm already at 12-14 credits because I don't want to sacrifice too much tempo putting it down.  Then, use it to deploy toolbox or R&amp;DI, and still maintain a very high amount of money to threaten remotes.<\/p>\n\n<p>The breakers are efficient as hell, and with toolbox out, you're breaking for very small amounts with opus fueling the fire.  Deep R&amp;D digs punish corps for letting you sit back and click for credits.<\/p>\n\n<p>Stimhack makes a 3 of appearance here because it helps cheat out breakers, and get in.  Best use is to stimhack into a remote with an SMC out, when the corp doens't rez because you have so much money, then you bust out a garrote\/blade\/corroder (in that order) and use the leftover stimhack credits + bank to trash the sansan.  If they rez, then great.  Don't use stimhack against jinteki, use the extra time it takes jinteki to win to instead, click for more mopus money.<\/p>\n\n<p>Also it screws with the corp's assessment of where you're at in your ability to hit a server.  With Opus out it's possible to go from 0 credits to 15 in 1 turn.  Sure, it works once you say?  The impact that it has on the corp is that they never quite feel safe installing into a remote very quickly, lest you get in and wreck it.  This means agendas pool in hand, which should be tough to afford defending if they're doing an adequate job defending R&amp;D.  Also cards like DL and sure gamble and LA are to be held back, obfuscating just how much running potential you have.<\/p>\n\n<p>Imagine as the corp you see the runner has 4 credits, and they're out of stimhacks, or its unlikely they have one.  With opus they can get 6 credits.  Your remote costs 13 to get in and you know it.  NOWS THE TIME!  IAA.  The runner then does 2 mopus 1 DL and then attacks you, now able to get in.  Thats the gist of the deck, hidden money.<\/p>\n\n<p>Finally, the card that makes this deck SING, and helps it do what old shaper opus couldn't.  It used to be that once you installed opus you had to dig for your expensive sentry breaker and not face check keeping the corp poor in the mean time.  Now, we have a lovely free +smc credits or free + clone chip to install destroyer breaker called sharpshooter.  This little guy busts up the big boys (ichi, archer, grim) for pennies.  And if you have SMC+clone chip up front, SMC for sharpshooter installing for 2, break for maximum 2, recur crescentus for 1 and close that shit up.  Grims just donated a bad pub, archers just cost an agenda, and ichi's cost 5\/9 for no gain!  Its like faerie, only native.<\/p>\n\n<p>What does it need?  Infiltration.  Three cards make this kind of deck good.  Opus for money generation, infiltration to make sure I have to run that card (if I don't i get 6 credits from opus and await your next move), and finally stimhack to help get the agenda I just infiltrated.  These 3 cards MAKE big rig shaper work.  We abandoned this for criminal just too soon when we got SMC and clonechip to tutor for us.  Gone are the days of playing 2-3 copies and diesel and QT to find them.   We have the goods, we have the cash, we have the breakers, and we have the toolboxish programs.  It's better now than ever.<\/p>\n\n<p>Try it out, feel free to give me feedback.  I'ts good, its not amazing yet, but it is fun to play and it's good.<\/p>\n","username":"x3r0h0ur","cards":{"01004":3,"01007":1,"01033":1,"01034":3,"01035":3,"01036":3,"01038":3,"01041":2,"01043":1,"01044":3,"01050":3,"02009":2,"02022":3,"02065":1,"02107":3,"03038":3,"03046":3,"03052":3,"04065":1,"04067":1}},{"id":1676,"name":"Prochessor 2","creation":"2014-01-23 23:53:42","description":"\n","username":"liquidcooled","cards":{"01007":1,"01026":1,"01041":3,"01047":2,"01050":3,"01053":3,"02009":2,"02047":3,"02066":1,"02087":3,"02104":1,"03029":1,"03033":2,"03034":3,"03035":1,"03038":3,"03046":3,"03053":3,"03054":2,"04002":2,"04021":1,"04022":1,"04043":1,"04047":1,"04061":1,"04065":1}},{"id":1677,"name":"Do the Sundew","creation":"2014-01-23 23:57:47","description":"\n","username":"CodeMarvelous","cards":{"01068":3,"01077":3,"01078":2,"01084":2,"01104":3,"01109":3,"02013":2,"02014":3,"02029":3,"02031":1,"02032":1,"02033":2,"02039":2,"02095":3,"02112":2,"03027":3,"04015":3,"04054":3,"04060":3,"04074":3}}]

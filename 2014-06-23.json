Efficient running with their fixed breakers. The biggest problem with anarchs currently is getting breakers consistently. I tried to solve this with splashing special order from our beloved criminals as well as clone chip, in case something gets trashed. Clone chips do work here, they can do several things: get a parasite, knight or bishop (deep red) mid run. I went for the standard econ with Armitage, liberated daily and kati. I also added Lucky Find to get a bit more burst. Lucky Find > Sure gamble because of the lower entrance fee (3 instead of 5 creds does make a difference).<\/p>\n\n<p>Playstyle: Up to now I have only taken a mulligan if I had no econ card in my opening hand and it has worked out decently. Weyland has proven to be a bit of a tougher matchup since I'm not running any scorched counters. NBN has been ok, you can put enough early pressure on the corp with knight and parasite. Whizzards ability helps a lot dealing with unrezzed SanSans so you can stop the Astrotrain without denting your econ too much. Oh, and something about Morning Star: make your decision carefully when to bring the big guns. As a rule of thumb, having 2 elis or 2 hives or something similar rezzed is reason enough to get it. A final thought: work with what you have.

I have been playing some variation of this deck every week at my local tournaments for over a month now, and have been very happy with the results.<\/p>\n\n<p>The core concept remains the same. Tax them so much they can't afford to steal my agendas. Perhaps the biggest change was dropping all three Punitive Counterstrikes. They have won me games, so I was hesitant to do so, but I wanted the free influence and late game they can be a dead draw. I refocused myself on my original taxation concept.<\/p>\n\n<p>The economy is strong; probably stronger than it looks at first glance. Sundew is a monster; if you're opponent cannot get it off the field, they are in trouble. Private Contracts fits perfectly with how I run this deck. Celebrity Gift is likewise a monster; I'm not afraid to show an opponent a hand with a Future Perfect or a Fetal AI in it when I have a pair of ambushes in there as well. Subliminal Messaging is a free credit every turn they don't run, plus adding it back to your hand works rather well with Celebrity Gift.<\/p>\n\n<p>Agendas are exactly what you'd expect. NAPD Contract- that'll be four credits please. Fetal AI- two credits and two net damage. The  Future Pefect is just shenanigans. I dropped Philotic Entanglement for a third Future Perfect. I don't run enough agendas for it to ever do much damage (Its effectiveness with Shi.Kyu or against Notoriety not withstanding), and it got scored by my opponent nearly every game where I ran it. I would rather be certain they are paying more.<\/p>\n\n<p>ICE is the heart of this deck. <\/p>\n\n<p>Tollbooth is nearly the definition of this deck. Stick it on your scoring server and make sure they are paying an extra 3+ to steal anything. <\/p>\n\n<p>Tsurugi can be stuck anywhere, to ETR or damage the hell out of them. I often just use it as an ETR ICE on Scoring Servers or R&amp;D, but my opponents will always try and break all four subroutines, costing them as much as possible. <\/p>\n\n<p>RSVP is possibly the best ICE in the deck, though it doesn't look it. In front of R&amp;D it ensures they can't steal any of your Agendas; but they can still hit ambushes if they don't jack out. It can function the same way as HQ, Asset, or Agenda protection. Stick it in front of another ICE and watch it work as a makeshift Inazuma.<\/p>\n\n<p>Komainu is more taxing the more cards they have in their hand. I love having it in my opening hand to stick in front of HQ to avoid first turn Account Siphons.<\/p>\n\n<p>Himitsu Bako is Asset protection. I'll put it in front of Sundew and Jackson, or occasionally an early game agenda. Need it somewhere else? Move it!<\/p>\n\n<p>Snowflake is a new ICE I'm trying out. I'm hoping it can function as Asset protection when I need it, and at worst it can be further taxation, ensure at least 2 more credits for my opponents to get past it (even breaking it with Corroder would cost 2).<\/p>\n\n<p>Yagura and Shiro are R&amp;D Protection. Shiro is just fantastic with the number of ambushes in the deck. Yagura can be incredibly helpful as well.<\/p>\n\n<p>Inazuma is there to give life to a Komainu or Tsurugi after your opponent plays Mimic or another Killer, but it can also just be one more thing they need to break through if you toss it in front of Tollbooth.<\/p>\n\n<p>3x Shock!, 3x Snare, and 2x Shi.Kyu. I would actually love to fit a third Shi.Kyu back in as well. I always avoid installing ambushes. I don't try and play the bluff game- that's why all the ambushes are advanceless. Instead, I rely on them to punish access of Central Servers.<\/p>\n\n<p>Caprice Nisei is self-explanatory. Either play the Psi game to kick them out after paying through the nose to get in, or just make sure they need another 2 credits.<\/p>\n\n<p>Ash is a new addition made possible by dropping the Punitives. Without Links, it's four more credits they have to pay to score something. Time will tell how useful it can be.<\/p>\n\n<p>The only other card I think I did not mention would be Jackson Howard, who is there as draw power and archive protection as well as recirculating Snares late game, and a lone Closed Accounts, which has become my preferred way of punishing tag floaters or those who run into an ill timed Snare!.<\/p>\n\n<p>I play the deck slow. I don't try to rush out my agendas. I wait until my scoring server is a gigantic toll. I don't install The Future Perfect unless I am certain I can score it the following turn. I never  leave any agenda on the board for longer than one of the opponents turns.<\/p>\n\n<p>Feel free to tweak this list to your play style, and let me know if you have any feedback.<\/p>\n","username":"Cancer Ace","cards":{"01070":3,"01084":1,"01090":2,"02013":2,"02015":2,"02031":1,"02032":3,"02059":2,"04012":3,"04013":2,"04015":2,"04054":3,"04073":3,"04074":2,"04077":2,"04093":1,"04100":2,"04114":2,"04119":3,"05007":3,"05011":2,"05016":1,"05017":2,"05019":1}},{"id":7034,"name":"Extortion!!!","creation":"2014-06-23 14:55:26","description":"<p>I thought I would publish this deck that I have had a lot of success with lately.

However any advice would be happily accepted. The concept for this deck was originally to have lots of traps and almost no ice. However this just let the deck open to being pillaged by the runner in the central servers. So I tweaked some more and continued with my main emphasis being the Mushi no shin-Agenda\/trap-Trick of light-Bullfrog combo to either advance traps and later move to an agenda with trick of light or to direct the run towards a trap.

I was relying on Silencers and Switchblade for breaking sentries, with the limited-use Cerberus breakers as my primary means for getting through barriers and code gates. Remember all the code gates I saw on the Corp side? Yep, that's why we have 3 copies of Rex in the deck here. With Overmind included, this made for an interesting little deck that could snipe any one server when I needed to, but could not consistently maintain pressure on any server with more than a single sentry.<\/p>\n\n<p>Alright, let's talk about some of the other card choices here. R&amp;D Interface was the only multi-access card I recall seeing the whole draft, I picked it up immediately. Scavenges worked well to replenish the limited-use breakers. In a pinch, I could Aesop's them and Deja Vu a program back, but that was rather costly in regards to credits and clicks. I included Net Celebrity and Scrubbed simply to counter the Corp currents that I saw on that side of the draft. Scrubbed ended up being useless in this deck, while Net Celebrity more than pulled its weight. Akamatsu was Aesop's food, never needed the memory. Wyldside was the only form of card draw I saw in the draft and also paired well with Aesop's. Zona Sul Shipping ended up doing all the heavy lifting in my economy as a mini-Kati Jones, but it was fairly slow and still left me clicking for credits constantly. I'm not a big fan of Daily Casts in regular play, but beggars can't be choosers with economy in draft play. The Aesop's helped out a bit there as well. Ghost Runners were probably the MVP of the deck, allowing Switchblade to get through multi-sentry servers where the Silencers alone simply would not do. Along with seemingly everything else in the deck, they too served as Aesop's food once I got down to a credit left on them and I had enough Silencers to which I felt the 1 Ghost Runners credit was not necessary.<\/p>\n\n<p>I ended up running the table and going undefeated with the Runner. My closest match was against Katie and her deck of undying encrypted portal code gates. She got an early 4-0 lead and I face-planted into an Archer before the tables turned in my favor. Getting through Archer for free (via Switchblade and two recurring Silencer credits) does have that effect though. Eventually, she couldn't keep me out, and I caught up and won after establishing an R&amp;D lock with my R&amp;D Interface singleton. I also had a very close game against Craig's corp. He played with more of a horizontal server shell-game-esque strategy with several cheap sentries, that played right into my hand once I had the Switchblade\/Silencer set-up. I was able to keep constant pressure and kept him low on credits throughout to pull away with the win.<\/p>\n","username":"CrimsonWraith","cards":{"00006":1,"01002":2,"01016":1,"01038":1,"01047":2,"01050":2,"02107":1,"03034":2,"03053":1,"04104":3,"05042":1,"05053":2,"06034":1,"06038":1,"06040":2,"06077":3,"06096":3,"06097":1,"06099":1}},{"id":7040,"name":"Dipping Donuts","creation":"2014-06-23 19:09:29","description":"<p>I wanted to make a Donut and The Source based Iain deck, with all that resource stuff going on with him.  It obviously plays a lot differently than other runners people use, so you have to bear that in mind.  Install resource after resource, letting the corp gain a couple some agendas in the process, but never get so into building your own rig that you utterly ignore what he or she is doing.  The reason for no Special Orders is that I tried to do minimal events because of Donut but also that getting the breakers out slower will help your timing better, since Iain is a slow old man.  I haven't had problems yet, but I expect this'll bite me in the ass soon enough.

You shouldn't have to deal with too much surprise ice this way and you can make the corp rez ice on servers you don't want to run while simultaneously making them spend creds.<\/p>\n\n<p>After some testing, it's clear that this deck wants to set up for an explosive turn every 3-4 turns. Get everything ready for a couple of turns, see what the corp is up to, and then hit them with a devastating turn when they can't afford it. The Blackguard strategy doesn't even have to be used every game and can be thrown in as a surprise if you don't draw it early. 3x Mr. Li to get you Blackguard + Expose cards. <\/p>\n\n<p>Blackguard + Snitch combo with Xanadu + Rook = Sicknasty!<\/p>\n\n<p>Although it hasn't happened, I dream of the game where I Blackguard an Archer and the corp is forced to sac a Project Atlas...oh baby.<\/p>\n\n<p>Again, early testing still.

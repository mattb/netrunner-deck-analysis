The idea is to quickly gain access to all those expensive, brain-damage inducing bioroid ICE.<\/p>\n\n<p>You are looking to play ICE with Oversight AI and Awakening Centre first; these will cause the ICE to be trashed eventually, so you want to get that out of the way. If you get a Jackson out early, just mill your deck to get the big ICE and the other cards you need. Feel free to use your Archives as an extra repository for ICE and Assets.<\/p>\n\n<p>In phase two, you are using Howlers, Interns, Project Vitruvius and Archived Memories to pull the ICE and Assets out of Archives and playing them a second time. By now, you should have some economy and can afford to rez them the old-fashioned way.<\/p>\n\n<p>The economy is a little slow to get going, but a well-protected MMC is all you need. You can re-use Adonis campaign with Isabel McGuire by bouncing it back to HQ and re-installing it. Its not the most efficient, but it helps.<\/p>\n","username":"lostgrail","cards":{"01056":3,"01058":2,"01061":2,"01106":3,"01108":3,"02010":1,"02012":2,"02051":2,"02079":3,"03004":1,"03006":2,"03013":3,"03015":2,"03016":3,"03017":2,"03019":2,"03021":3,"04015":2,"04030":1,"04040":2,"04050":2,"04051":2,"04060":2}},{"id":1105,"name":"Little Doom","creation":"2013-12-24 22:03:19","description":"\n","username":"Wrathrage","cards":{"01002":3,"01006":2,"01008":1,"01009":2,"01012":2,"01016":2,"01018":2,"01051":2,"02001":1,"02003":1,"02009":3,"02042":2,"02065":2,"02081":3,"02101":3,"02103":3,"03035":1,"03052":3,"03053":2,"03054":3,"04005":2,"04029":1}}]

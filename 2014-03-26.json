Effectively you would force the runner to have to waste 3 clicks, take 2 damage and spend a good pile of credits just to take a look at a remote once. Then you recur your Ash with Howards or Interns.<\/p>\n\n<p>Sundew is the star of this deck. Protect it early with a Chimera or leave it unprotected if the runner does not trash assets and it can proivide a truckload of money over the course of the game.<\/p>\n\n<p>This is a version with less econ (just 6 assets) but with 3 shocks instead. Those in turn function kinda like a soft econ, as you can drop them in archives and discourage sucker\/desperado runs without using any ICE. Unfortunately the runner can still run and jackout without accessing, so eventually you'll prolly want something light as well there, like a shadow.<\/p>\n\n<p>Because shocks discourage Archives access, very often you'll be able to hide one or two agendas in there for a longer time than usual, giving you a breather.<\/p>\n\n<p>Closed Accounts might seem like a weird card in this deck, but it has caught a lot of players unaware, especially if they gathered a few tags from shadows before this hit the table. However it's there primarily for counter to tag-me\/siphon runners, because otherwise they will walk all over you.<\/p>\n\n<p>v5 Ditches the Braintrusts in favour of \"expensive to steal\" agendas as I always felt exposed when holding a Braintrust in my hand as it was just free points for the runner in a lightly defended HQ and R&amp;D.<\/p>\n\n<p>I was considering adding Caprice Nisei, but I'm not sure what to cut and I feel that a deck with such light ice can't make that good use of Caprice anyway.

I try to offset the horrible price tag on Replicator engines by running burst economy, and then use Professional Contacts to keep the events coming. I haven't had a chance to run this deck (no DT yet), but I think that the money should be piling in due to Replicator robbing your deck of anything that isn't events, essentially.<\/p>\n\n<p>The actual working part of the deck is Gordian Blade's ability with keeping its strength up through ice, and Paintbrush's ability to make everything Code Gates.

This deck is designed to exploit the 5 click advantage that GRNDL starts with to outrace the Runner's use of Bad Publicity credits.  Phase 1 should be constructing defenses for HQ and R&amp;D, coupled with an attempt to Plan B an Agenda out of hand.  Phase 2 should focus on shell gaming the Runner with Plan B and Agendas while layering a second set of ICE on the servers.  If Phase 3 is reached before GRNDL QaaC can threaten match point, then Project Junebug should be installed via Mushin for an attempted flatline.<\/p>\n\n<h1>ECONOMY:<\/h1>\n\n<p>GRNDL QaaC is utilizing the GRNDL starting advantage with traditional GRNDL economy cards of Geothermal Fracking, Profiteering, Restructure, and Hedge Fund.  Unfortunately, there is not enough influence to bring in stronger economy and the goal of QaaC is to be fast enough that GRNDL Refineries will hinder rather than help.<\/p>\n\n<h1>AGENDA:<\/h1>\n\n<p>GRNDL QaaC wants to drop and score Agendas faster than the Runner anticipates, and as such wants to draw Agendas quickly.  The Agenda density is high with low point Agendas.  Geothermal Fracking, Hostile Takeover, and Profiteering boost economy with their points.  Vulcan Coverup will disrupt Runner tempo and set them back a couple of clicks.  Project Atlas is included strictly as a 3\/2 high efficiency Agenda.  In addition, every Agenda except Geothermal Fracking is within reach of a Mushin No Shin installed Plan B without an additional advancement token, and even Geothermal Fracking is in reach if the third click is spent putting a fourth advancement token on Plan B.  With the speed that QaaC is intended to operate at, the Runner should not be able to afford to guess if a Mushin drop is a Plan B or not.<\/p>\n\n<h1>ASSET:<\/h1>\n\n<p>Plan B is included as both Runner tempo disruption and as extra protection for your Agendas.  Jackson Howard is present primarily for card draws.  Project Junebug is the backup plan for a Runner that manages to assemble a fast rig.  Installing Project Junebug with Mushin No Shin against a Runner that is not expecting a damage trap during Phase 2\/3 should result in a flatline.<\/p>\n\n<h1>OPERATIONS:<\/h1>\n\n<p>GRNDL QaaC is concerned with completing Agendas as Rushed as possible.  The only operations carried out by QaaC are Hedge Fund and Restructure to fuel the Economy, and Mushin No Shin to help rush agendas or setup Plan B\/Project Junebug traps.<\/p>\n\n<h1>ICE:<\/h1>\n\n<p>GRNDL QaaC doesn't have time to play with anything except End the Run ICE.  Chimera, Hadrian's Wall and Draco (with at minimum 9 strength) should be the Go-To ICE for most situations, presenting GRNDL rez capable ICE in Phase 1 and 2 that the Runner cannot break.  Guard is present to trip up Inside Jobs, and Archer to present teeth against an aggressive Runner.<\/p>\n\n<h1>FUTURE:<\/h1>\n\n<p>Depending on performance, Jackson Howard and Project Junebug will be evaluated against protective Upgrades such as Caprice or Ash.<\/p>\n","username":"bubo","cards":{"01069":2,"01094":3,"01101":2,"01102":3,"01110":3,"02018":3,"02020":3,"02060":3,"04015":2,"04017":3,"04039":3,"04040":3,"04097":1,"04098":3,"05015":3,"05023":3,"05024":3}},{"id":3503,"name":"Reina Roja: Miedo y Par\u00e1sitos","creation":"2014-03-26 15:48:50","description":"\n","username":"zzorba","cards":{"01002":3,"01006":3,"01007":2,"01008":2,"01009":3,"01011":3,"01012":2,"01014":2,"01018":2,"01022":2,"01050":3,"01053":3,"02003":1,"02009":2,"02022":3,"02041":1,"02087":3,"04041":1,"04043":3,"04061":3}},{"id":3504,"name":"Jinteki RP: Encrypt deck.

Ever since the early days when people shrugged at her saying \"Lol 10 Influence,\" I've been running Kit, toying around with different methods like Big Rig, Personal Workshop, Torch, Paintbrush, Yogasaurus, Omnidrive, Silver Bullet and other themes.  Here is something that I feel is a good, happy medium between a lot of Kit's strategies.  <\/p>\n\n<p>The core to this deck: <a href=\"\/en\/card\/03044\">Cyber-Cypher<\/a> - One of these (or an SMC) on turn one means you're getting into that server.  With an insanely cheap install cost coupled with cost effective running, this is by far my favorite Decoder in Kit's arsenal.  <a href=\"\/en\/card\/03034\">Scavenge<\/a> should be used to \"retarget\" your CC's on new servers.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"\/en\/card\/01044\">Magnum Opus<\/a> and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02091\">Kati Jones<\/a> are the driving economic force, though an early <a href=\"\/en\/card\/03049\">Professional Contacts<\/a> adds up quickly.  Overall, running should be fairly efficient between CC's high strength, <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04006\">Lockpick<\/a>, and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01024\">Desperado<\/a>.  I even threw in a copy of <a href=\"\/en\/card\/06038\">Net Celebrity<\/a> which isn't bad considering it pays for itself in one run, but honestly, I haven't been able to test it yet; it's mostly there just in case all of those amazing Corp currents start seeing play.<\/p>\n\n<p>Dig deep with <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02041\">Nerve Agent<\/a> and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02107\">R&amp;D Interface<\/a>; this will force them to overstock on protection.  1 copy of <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01008\">Datasucker<\/a> is in the deck because, honestly, I had 1 influence left.  Datasucker is just such a good card, especially paired with Desperado and since you can tutor for it, it's nice to have in there for the games you know you'll want it.<\/p>\n\n<p>Overall, memory isn't a problem thanks to <a href=\"\/en\/card\/06019\">Leprechaun<\/a>; use them to store Opus, SMC, and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04108\">Paintbrush<\/a> which is just about the cheapest memory you can ask for (2 credit install in order to free up 3 memory).  But one <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01038\">Akamatsu Mem Chip<\/a> is still in (along with your Desperado memory) just in case, though that card might be cut if Leprechaun continues to be awesome.<\/p>\n\n<p>Also note that <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04108\">Paintbrush<\/a> is NOT a must in this deck.  Tinkering will do work on its own.  But, if you're running against huge mega servers, it's best to be turning everything into Code Gates since Inti isn't efficient and Femme is rarely used to actually break Sentries.<\/p>\n\n<p>Honestly, I foresee this deck morphing very soon.  The next datapack will include Refractor, a shiny new decoder that uses Stealth credits.  Once that hits, this deck will likely forego Cyber-Cypher and also find room for Cloak\/Dagger.  But I look forward to continuing to refine this deck until its something special.<\/p>\n","username":"BreadRising","cards":{"01008":1,"01024":2,"01026":1,"01037":3,"01038":1,"01044":2,"01050":3,"02009":1,"02041":1,"02047":3,"02066":1,"02091":2,"02107":3,"03028":1,"03034":3,"03038":3,"03044":3,"03046":3,"03048":1,"03049":2,"04006":2,"04108":1,"06019":2,"06038":1}},{"id":8661,"name":"Big Toys","creation":"2014-08-18 04:23:31","description":"<p>A straightforward deck using <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02047\">Test Run<\/a> and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/03046\">Self-modifying Code<\/a> to tutor out <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01044\">Magnum Opus<\/a> ASAP to fund the big toys.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"\/en\/card\/05035\">Legwork<\/a> and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01036\">The Maker's Eye<\/a> for surprise accesses.<\/p>\n\n<p>Comments appreciated, been refining this for quite awhile, looking forward to it being torn apart by internet wolves :)<\/p>\n","username":"Inova","cards":{"01034":3,"01036":2,"01039":2,"01041":2,"01044":3,"01050":2,"02004":1,"02008":2,"02009":1,"02028":2,"02046":1,"02047":3,"03038":2,"03046":3,"03050":2,"04047":2,"04065":2,"04067":2,"04108":1,"05035":2,"06020":1}},{"id":8662,"name":"Nasir Parasite","creation":"2014-08-18 05:37:28","description":"<p>Classic Recurring Parasite combo, using Nasir + Personnal Workshop as fuel for economy.

Practically every Anarch source of denial is available in this deck, from creds (Reina, Vamp, Lamprey) to cards (DLR, Keyhole, Imp) to clicks (through forcing the corp to purge viruses).<\/p>\n\n<p>This is really an anti-deck, designed to take advantage of corps who only lightly ice centrals to try to keep you out then either go for fast advance or the shell game. This could be to the detriment of your matchup with glacier decks, but I believe it's a tradeoff worth making.<\/p>\n\n<h4>How to Play &amp; Card Choices<\/h4>\n\n<p>Your primary game plan is to hit HQ over and over, building up cash through Desperado and making the corp poor with <a href=\"\/en\/card\/06014\">Lamprey<\/a>.

Welcome to Jinteki's first quarter 2014 Results Conference Cast. This cast is being recorded for replay purposes.<\/p>\n\n<p>All participants are currently in a listen-only mode. Following the conference, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. At this time, I would like to turn the cast over to Senior Director Toshiyuki Sakai for introductory remarks.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Slide: Jinteki Q1 2014 Earnings Cast<\/h3>\n\n<p><strong>SAKAI:<\/strong> Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone. We announced Jinteki's first quarter results for the 2014 fiscal year after the close of trading today. Our financial results should now be available at our Investor Relations site, as will be the recorded cast for this cast.<\/p>\n\n<p>Before we dive into our results, we would like to call attention to our recent showing at Gen Con Nationals, where our sysops were able to demonstrate, in a friendly setting, how our latest offerings perform against the most notorious black hat hackers. We were proud to see our security tech go undefeated during the final day, 64-person event. It also dominated, for the most part, the 128-person precursor event. Yesterday, renowned architect Lukas Litzsinger, co-creator of the net's source protocols, ran a field test against our technology and flatlined after we forced him into a series of lose-lose situations.<\/p>\n\n<p>We believe the results from Nationals and the previous quarter validate the recent infrastructure updates Jinteki has put into place, as well as our controversial partnership with competitor Haas-Bioroid. After studying the results reported by <a href=\"http:\/\/netrunnerdb.com\/en\/decklist\/4964\/untrashable-v6\">db0's Untrashable trials<\/a> and our own in-house experiments with variants, we managed to implement an overwhelming number of assets and network infrastructure upgrades, requiring opponents to expend a considerable amount of time and resources to attack our properties, especially with the introduction of <em>Encryption Protocols<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Slide: Credits Rule Everything Around Me \/\/ Econ<\/h3>\n\n<p>We are pleased to report that our fixed assets that have generated a healthy drip economy for Jinteki in the previous quarter, if not a flood. Thanks to the success of our <em>Sundew<\/em> efforts, <em>PAD Campaigns<\/em>, and <em>Mental Health Clinic<\/em> branches, we dramatically increased revenues year-over-over for the quarter.<\/p>\n\n<p>This approach is vulnerable to attacks from outside forces -- unlike safe bets with hedge funds or Jinteki's previous lucrative efforts with tiny giraffes -- but protecting these resources with taxing security measures can ward them off until we can deluge our servers with assets and <em>Encryption Protocols<\/em>. We have also recruited several talented students from Levy University as <em>Interns<\/em> to recover and re-install lost <em>Sundews<\/em>, critical upgrades, and even ICE [Intrusion Countermeasures Electronics] cheaply.<\/p>\n\n<p>It's worth noting that we recently hired the esteemed <em>Jackson Howard<\/em> to assist with our cloning initiatives. He's been invaluable in not only helping accelerate R&amp;D on economy assets and ICE, but also resurrecting cancelled but promising projects.<\/p>\n\n<p>I will now turn the cast over to Ms. Tori Hanzo to share the moves we've made this previous quarter to cut our operating costs.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Slide: Protect Ya Neck \/\/ Traps<\/h3>\n\n<p><strong>HANZO:<\/strong> Thank you, Senior Director. As you know, Jinteki retired its long-running Junebug bioengineering project last quarter in favor of inexpensive but effective deterrents, such as Shocks, Snares, and Shi.Ky\u016bs. Though we have since suspended these so-called \"ambush\" disincentives, we continue to employ a <em>Ronin<\/em>, hostile tech that can serve as a distraction and a potential punishment for careless runners.<\/p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, we are capitalizing on <em>Hokusai Grids<\/em> to protect weak points where runners can access, serving as stopgaps until we can install stronger ICE, or adding an extra bite to <em>Sundew<\/em> servers that our opponents try to access. These facilities are expensive for intruders to disable, and hackers sometimes avoid them completely, expecting them to be safeguarded by <em>Caprice<\/em>. Her reputation amongst the \"runner\" community is formidable, and that alone is often more than enough to dissuade them from attacking.<\/p>\n\n<p>Our Chairman can talk more at length about <em>Caprice<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Slide: Only Built for Caprice Linx \/\/ Upgrades<\/h3>\n\n<p><strong>HIRO:<\/strong> Yes, we recently welcomed Ms. <em>Caprice Nisei<\/em> back to the fold and integrated her into our countermeasures. We have been able to utilize her uncanny abilities and the detective skills she picked up during her time working with the New Angeles Police Department to block illegal incursions into our servers. For runners who do manage to make it past our defenses and even siphon our funds, we have an agreement with media corporation NBN allowing us to track these criminals when possible to close their accounts. <\/p>\n\n<p>As our Senior Director noted earlier, we have partnered with Haas-Bioroid for a limited exchange of technology, which includes an agreement to lease the company's <em>Ash<\/em> bioroid line. Pairing Ms. <em>Nisei<\/em> with these bioroids forces our opponents to waste a significant amount of credits and time to access any agendas or assets. Taking this into account with our <em>Encryption Protocols<\/em>, expensive assets that hackers cannot ignore, and work compression advantages, we are able to easily open windows for the company to push through its initiatives.<\/p>\n\n<p>One of our sysops  will now discuss the lengths Jinteki has gone to in order to protect our servers and those initiatives.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Slide: Clan In Da Front \/\/ ICE<\/h3>\n\n<p><strong>MIDORI:<\/strong> Okay, while we tend to install fewer and more porous ICE than some of our competitors, we try to make up for it with adaptable ICE like <em>Chimera<\/em>, as well as cheap but annoying ICE like <em>Yagura<\/em> and <em>Pup<\/em>, which work great to slow down runners looking to get an early advantage on us. We also have some nasty and taxing ICE like <em>Komainu<\/em> and <em>Tsurugi<\/em>, which can bleed those hackers dry if they want to make repeated runs on our servers. <\/p>\n\n<p>Sure, they're not the strongest ICE and susceptible to virus attacks -- unless you count our new <em>Lotus Field<\/em> tech -- but keep in mind that it costs us nothing to bring them back online if they're taken down, thanks to the <em>Interns<\/em> we've got working around the clock. The <em>Swordsman<\/em> ICE we've thrown in is also a mean surprise for any hacker reliant on AI breakers, so long as it's timed to activate when there aren't any Clone Chips, Deus Exes, and Sharpshooters in play. The few ICE we've leased from other companies, HB's <em>Viper<\/em> and NBN's <em>Tollbooth<\/em>, fit our goals of taxing runners, whether it's through their time or bank accounts. <\/p>\n\n<p>I think that's all I had to mention regarding our ICE. I'll hand this back over to our Chairman.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Slide: Can It All Be So Simple \/\/ Agendas<\/h3>\n\n<p><strong>HIRO:<\/strong> Before we get into the Q&amp;A, I'd like to mention that we have some very exciting opportunities ahead of Jinteki. Thanks to our ties to the New Angeles PD -- through Commissioner Dawn and Ms. <em>Caprice Nisei's<\/em> work there -- as well as the nature of our classified artificial intelligence projects, it's become more difficult and expensive for opponents to steal our work. With developments down the line like our <em>Future Perfect<\/em> program, we can make it near impossible.<\/p>\n\n<p>We also have other non-cloning advancements we'll announce in the near future, coming out of our biomedical Harmony Medtech division and our stealth groups at the Tennin Institute. That's not to say we intend to pivot our focus away from cloning, however. Cloning has the potential to replicate perfection. Let me repeat that: cloning has the potential to replicate perfection. Should we aspire to anything less?<\/p>\n\n<p>With that, I'd like to open the cast to your questions.<\/p>\n","username":"ekayohlee","cards":{"01084":1,"01090":1,"01109":2,"02013":2,"02029":3,"02031":1,"02032":3,"02052":2,"02060":2,"02095":2,"02112":1,"04015":3,"04033":1,"04054":3,"04060":3,"04074":2,"04093":1,"04114":2,"04119":3,"05006":1,"05007":2,"05009":3,"05017":2,"05018":3,"06003":1}},{"id":8679,"name":"NovaBiotics - 16th in Flight 2 at GenCon and 38th in the fin","creation":"2014-08-18 13:27:10","description":"<p>This was the corp deck that I took to GenCon flight 2 and to the finals. <\/p>\n\n<p>The big difference is that I drop the 3rd biotic labor for two archers, which straight up won me games by trashing a rig. <\/p>\n\n<p>There is also only a single SanSan and that is an artifact from the deck I played in flight one, and me not wanting to overhaul the deck too much before the second flight. <\/p>\n","username":"Ravlin","cards":{"01059":2,"01064":2,"01081":3,"01082":2,"01090":2,"01092":1,"01101":2,"01108":3,"01110":3,"02055":3,"02110":3,"02115":3,"02117":1,"04015":3,"04040":3,"04076":3,"04096":3,"04119":3,"04120":2,"05024":2,"06005":1}},{"id":8680,"name":"Moon Archery","creation":"2014-08-18 13:31:11","description":"<p>A close deck to any Yellow Jackets, but going for Archer instead of Shinobi.

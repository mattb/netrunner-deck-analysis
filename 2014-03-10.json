If you have a Nisei and they run your Ruhr-remote, end the run when they've gone through all ice = 1 click left, they can't run it again.\nA totally safe 3-pointer! Best when ending the game since runners tend to forget to do the math\/about the Nisei counter when they're excited. Extremely satisfying when runners realize they were shut out from beginning and just wasted their turn on nothing ;)  <\/p>\n\n<p>Had thoughts about putting Strongbox in but realized that it doesn't work very well with the Executive end game scoring part of the strategy so took it out and put in some vipers and anti-tag float instead.<\/p>\n","username":"parasitetwin","cards":{"01068":3,"01069":1,"01070":3,"01077":1,"01078":3,"01084":1,"01090":1,"01109":2,"01110":3,"02014":3,"02031":1,"02039":2,"02052":3,"02060":2,"02080":2,"02111":2,"03012":1,"03026":2,"04012":3,"04015":2,"04020":1,"04033":1,"04054":3,"04060":1,"04074":3}},{"id":3021,"name":"CT Hates Fast Advance","creation":"2014-03-10 19:54:02","description":"<p>First off, let me be clear that I have yet to test this deck at all.

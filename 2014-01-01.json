It's the equivalent of some card making runners spend two clicks to run on remotes, which is interesting, but who runs on Jinteki remotes? Most often R&amp;D lock is what you'll be facing, so it doesn't help a whole lot it seems. But that wont stop me from trying. This deck tries to make the most use of remotes and make central servers painful. The idea is to use Trick of Light to advance agendas, making dead traps useful. Shipment allows you to install three remotes and advance one, either a trap or ambush, in one turn.<\/p>\n","username":"vdude","cards":{"01060":3,"01062":1,"01068":3,"01069":2,"01070":3,"01075":3,"01077":3,"01090":1,"01103":3,"01107":1,"01109":3,"01110":3,"01111":3,"02014":3,"02031":1,"02032":3,"02033":3,"02112":2,"04012":3,"04015":2,"04033":1}},{"id":1195,"name":"NEXT: Director's Cut 1.3","creation":"2014-01-01 19:33:58","description":"<p>Based on the deck found here: http:\/\/boardgamegeek.com\/thread\/1079213\/next-design-analysis-of-its-mechanics-on-a-sampl\nThe idea is to score ABT in turn 2.

Added dirty laundry and Kati to get Econ going earlier, no more personal workshop, console, or mem chip, Escher is in to keep a player from making a 3 sentry server which is bad for cloak and dagger.  Also added account siphon, because I think it may be worth it, even if I have to play snowball and 3 nach instead of corroder and decoy.  <\/p>\n\n<p>After a few games, this feels much better than the first version.  You can get rolling applying pressure earlier, and then add to your rig as you need to.  Power shutdown sniping cloaks is a big problem and the rig is a bit fragile, so you need to be cautious and protect it, I think I will get clone chip in here in the next iteration.  Similarly, troubleshooter can be big trouble with dagger.  No expose and no sot are also pieces that would be really nice to have, but not sure how to fit in yet.<\/p>\n\n<p>I first had two Gordianblade but dropped one for a crypsis, because I got totally locked out by a single chimera in a game against a twiy rush deck.<\/p>\n","username":"Garbo","cards":{"01004":3,"01018":3,"01040":2,"01043":1,"01050":3,"01051":1,"02027":2,"02046":1,"02050":2,"02091":2,"02107":3,"02109":3,"03031":1,"03041":3,"03042":2,"03046":3,"03049":3,"03052":3}}]

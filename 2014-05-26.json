It seems like a card with some very powerful potential, but I struggled to make it click. I had previous decks with Kate and Chaos Theory, but they struggled to apply pressure reliably in the early game. Also, I felt that I was putting in some bits of hardware to help Replicator get more use, rather than because they would help me win the game.<\/p>\n\n<p>Enter Kit. She doesn't have the inbuilt advantages of Kate or CT, or even the same amount of influence, but she does have her 'Make-a-Gate' ability. All you need is a decoder and you can crack any single ice server. And on the hardware front, you are guaranteed to get use out of Lockpick.<\/p>\n\n<p>BREAKDOWN:<\/p>\n\n<p>PROGRAMS: I haven't played with this deck enough to be fully confident in my choices here. Zu.13 is perfect, with its efficiency and cost of one, as an early game breaker. Torch is meant as a late game play, where its higher STR gets it through most code gates trivially. However, Cyber-Cypher has the same strength, and costs 7 less, although it obviously loses flexibility. I'm sticking with Torch for the moment, as it helps more when you need to crack a big remote.<\/p>\n\n<p>I dislike both sentry breakers, but since I dislike almost all available killers, they'll have to do. \nSnowball will do, since I don't have the influence for Corroders. Omega is slightly too pricey for my liking, but being able to crack any 2-deep server with just two breakers is pretty brutal, and puts a lot of pressure on the corp.<\/p>\n\n<p>EVENTS: Money, card draw, and an Escher to mess things up if the corp puts up some effective defences.<\/p>\n\n<p>RESOURCES: Money and card draw, with an Escher to ruin their defensive setup. I was back and forth on Armitage vs daily casts, but I prefer the burst potential of Armitage, and the cheaper install cost. Inside man does a lot of work in this deck mid-late game, but doesn't always arrive at the right time.<\/p>\n\n<p>HARDWARE: Cyberfeeder and Lockpick are recurring credits, as is the Spinal Modem. I might drop the latter to free up some influence, but I am happy with it so far. Plascrete is a necessary evil. RDI to help digging. Replicator to help get multiples of all of these out. It also helps thin the deck.<\/p>\n\n<p>HOW TO USE IT: I struggled a lot in the initial games with it because I was looking for the Replicator to click before I did anything. This worked okay with CT and Kate, but with Kit you lose the early pressure advantage of her ability. So now, I'll mulligan if I do not get a Zu.13 or SMC or Torch. Get a decoder down, and start hassling. Kit works best making one run a turn, use the events and clicks to get a full hand again. If you can get the replicator train rolling, brilliant, but don't sacrifice tempo for it. If your opponent can only lightly ice his servers, go for blood. Don't wait for the replicators; the hardware is in the deck to be stand-alone useful, you'll get more advantage of playing them when needed as opposed to waiting for the combo.<\/p>\n\n<p>Any comments would be appreciated!<\/p>\n","username":"Jashay","cards":{"01005":3,"01011":1,"01027":1,"01034":3,"01050":3,"01053":3,"02002":2,"02007":3,"02009":2,"02027":2,"02068":2,"02087":3,"02088":3,"02091":2,"02107":3,"03028":1,"03031":1,"03046":3,"03052":3,"04006":3,"04047":1,"04088":2}},{"id":6058,"name":"Psionic Tag Punishment (Scorcha' Killa' V2)","creation":"2014-05-26 08:42:28","description":"<p>Through further testing I found the hnters didn't get much done so I traded them in for Tsurugis.<\/p>\n\n<p>Losing a scorched earth did hurt but I found closed accounts easier to pull off with decent effect and it combos nicely with MRF econ and can turn the deck into something much more taxing though less deadly<\/p>\n","username":"Trizzy613","cards":{"01062":1,"01070":3,"01072":3,"01077":2,"01084":2,"01099":2,"01110":3,"02014":3,"02015":3,"02080":3,"04015":3,"04074":1,"04093":1,"04114":2,"05002":1,"05005":3,"05006":1,"05007":1,"05010":3,"05013":3,"05014":3,"05016":2,"05017":1}},{"id":6059,"name":"The Motivated clone","creation":"2014-05-26 09:16:07","description":"\n","username":"CodeMarvelous","cards":{"01007":2,"01018":3,"01021":2,"01022":3,"01027":1,"01036":3,"01043":1,"01050":3,"02009":2,"02064":2,"02104":3,"03052":3,"03054":3,"04004":2,"04008":2,"04089":1,"05029":1,"05032":2,"05035":3,"05038":2,"05054":2}},{"id":6060,"name":"Kate'n Friends","creation":"2014-05-26 09:25:45","description":"\n","username":"RabeiUsura","cards":{"01005":3,"01012":3,"01033":1,"01041":2,"01044":2,"01050":3,"01051":1,"02009":2,"02028":3,"02047":2,"02066":1,"02069":3,"02091":2,"02107":3,"03035":2,"03038":3,"03046":2,"03049":2,"04087":2,"04088":2,"04109":3}},{"id":6061,"name":"Tenma lean forward Deck","creation":"2014-05-26 09:27:15","description":"\n","username":"cactusman","cards":{"01007":1,"01008":3,"01011":1,"01014":1,"01018":3,"01021":3,"01022":3,"01024":3,"01026":1,"01050":3,"02009":2,"02021":1,"02043":3,"02091":2,"02104":1,"02106":1,"03035":1,"03049":1,"03052":3,"03054":3,"04004":2,"05029":1,"05034":2,"05036":1}},{"id":6062,"name":"Tennin's Trick","creation":"2014-05-26 09:28:22","description":"<p>Tehshi-chan maji kawaiiyo!<\/p>\n","username":"Mistines","cards":{"01084":1,"01103":3,"01109":3,"01110":3,"02014":3,"02033":3,"04012":2,"04015":3,"04020":1,"04033":1,"04073":3,"04093":2,"04099":2,"04111":2,"05003":1,"05004":3,"05005":3,"05006":1,"05007":1,"05016":2,"05017":3,"05018":2,"05020":1}},{"id":6063,"name":"ModernSuperism (Restructured)","creation":"2014-05-26 09:48:43","description":"<p>I've played a Supermodernism deck for a while now, and I thought I'd try my hand at putting my own spin on it.

This deck is custom built for that type of playstyle. Run early, run alot. Have the corp in it's toes, and eventually build up your rig and start digging.<\/p>\n\n<h3>The Cards<\/h3>\n\n<p>Many cards speak for themselves, but I will focus on some of the core mechanics and their cards.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Account Siphon and Indexing<\/h2>\n\n<p>These are the best cards to get early, I almost always keep my   hand if I find both in my starting hand.  Both cards puts high pressure on the corp. I usually start with a run on HQ, if rez, I index R&amp;D, if the other way around, I Siphon their accounts. Some rush decks will stop both, centrals, but then you know early what kind of deck you are up against. A rule of thumb is to always Account Siphon on your second click, so you can remove the tags.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Self-modifying Code and Clone Chip<\/h2>\n\n<p>This combo has seen many plays before, so I am certain you are familiar with the tactic. Face check with SMC so that you can pull out any breaker you want (keep yourself over 5 credits, preferably around 10). Deus Ex gets rid of all the ice that hurts you (net and brain damage) and Sharpshooter prevents your precious programs from getting trashed.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Ice Breakers<\/h2>\n\n<p>Corroder is an auto include, not much to say there. Zu.13 is just really cheap and easy to pull with SMC. Femme Fatale is a real pain in the ass to hard install (paying full price), but her bypass have always paid out. My theory is that Overmind will be insanely good as early aggression with CT, break those first end the ices and they'll wish they had more subroutines. Use Clone Chip to retrieve SMC (mid-run even) or any of your ice-breakers.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Strategy<\/h3>\n\n<p>Run on your first click, if you get beaten up fine, nothing can kill you in the first turn. If you run into a neural katana, just jack out and draw some cards. As the game progresses, use the standard rule of thumb: Remotes -> HQ -> R&amp;D -> Archives. But if you can, pressure the centrals with Siphon and Indexing. This locks down R&amp;D (that is what this deck does best) and keeping the corp poor (and you filthy rich).<\/p>\n\n<h5>Good luck and have fun!<\/h5>\n","username":"Oathwood","cards":{"01007":1,"01018":1,"01026":1,"01034":3,"01036":1,"01044":1,"01050":3,"01053":2,"02007":1,"02046":1,"02050":3,"02066":1,"02091":3,"02106":1,"02107":2,"03035":1,"03038":3,"03046":3,"03054":3,"04067":1,"05036":2,"05037":2,"05053":1}},{"id":6071,"name":"Arrested Development V0.3","creation":"2014-05-26 14:45:24","description":"<p>Switched out the Corporate Wars for 2 Project Atlas' as per GPWK's suggestion.<\/p>\n","username":"wswan","cards":{"01057":2,"01064":1,"01069":1,"01090":1,"01093":1,"01094":2,"01095":2,"01098":3,"01099":2,"01100":2,"01101":2,"01103":2,"01104":1,"01106":1,"01110":3,"01111":1,"02018":3,"02020":1,"02116":1,"03027":1,"04015":2,"04018":1,"04020":1,"04033":1,"04036":1,"04040":1,"04059":1,"04078":1,"04099":2,"04117":1,"04118":2,"04119":2,"04120":1}},{"id":6072,"name":"1984","creation":"2014-05-26 14:46:38","description":"<p>My version of a Midseason\/Psychographics\/Beale deck.

Won 2 local tournaments.<\/p>\n\n<p>The goal is to get filthy rich and then flatline the runner using Punitive Counterstrike. On top of that it can be, and often is, played normally by just scoring agendas.<\/p>\n\n<p>It's very easy to get up to 50 creds. If you're rich and have 2 Punitives (or 1 and Archived Memories\/Vitruvius counter) in your hand, you can start scoring agendas in the open. Taking them would mean a flatline. <\/p>\n\n<p>Jacksons recycle agendas if you're not yet ready for the kill, but they can also pull off a neat little trick. If you have only 1 Punitive or the runner has a ton of meat damage protection, stash 2 or more agendas in the archives and put Jackson in a protected server. When Jackson is protected, the runner usually goes for the archives to get rid of him. When he runs the archives, you can decide how many points you're gonna let him have, giving you flexibility for the kill. So if you can, let him have 6.<\/p>\n\n<p>Paired with a Corporate Troubleshooter or an unsuspecting runner, Shinobi can also flatline. Having a gazillion credits makes this a viable strategy. You'll need this many credits to flatline the runner:<\/p>\n\n<p>3x(runner's creds + link + bad pub) + 4 + Troubleshooter creds<\/p>\n\n<p>Most of the time you only need to run the last 2 subs. Even better if you put some ice in front of Shinobi, because every cred the runner spends on breaking is worth 2-3 to you.<\/p>\n\n<p>Power Grid Overload and Flare are there for Plascrete.<\/p>\n\n<p>Another good thing about the deck is that the strategy doesn't interfere with normal play. There's enough money and ice to slow advance the agendas. Corporate Troubleshooter plays a part here as well, as you can use heaps of money to pump a Wall of Static to +30 if need be to score a 3 pointer.<\/p>\n","username":"innerfifth","cards":{"01054":1,"01056":3,"01058":2,"01061":2,"01062":2,"01064":2,"01065":2,"01106":3,"01109":3,"01110":3,"01111":3,"01113":2,"02037":1,"02051":1,"02092":3,"02110":3,"02117":1,"03006":3,"04015":2,"04030":1,"04040":3,"04079":3,"04115":1}},{"id":6081,"name":"HB Big ICE","creation":"2014-05-26 20:15:25","description":"<p>Amass credits, set up a scoring server whilst locking them out of whatever server they run the most.

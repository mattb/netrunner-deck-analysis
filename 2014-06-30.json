Today, I\u2019m happy to share with you a deck, which I\u2019ve been playing for the past month and a bit more. Yesterday, were the Regionals here in Sofia, at which I finished <strong>2nd from 11 players total<\/strong>, with a score of <strong>6-2 (W:L)<\/strong> in 4 rounds of SWIS. Both my corp and runner deck went <em>3-1<\/em>, but the corp deck (which I will refer to from now on as \u201cperfect marketing\u201d ) could have easily went 4-0 and bring me the first place \u2013 if it wasn\u2019t for a horrid draw  ( no ice first 3-4 turns in a 17\/49 ICE deck) + big play mistake on my side at match point.  <\/p>\n\n<h4><strong>So where to begin \u2026<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n<p>First, this deck is a modified version of my \u201cGood Guy Replication\u201d deck (should be in \u201cderived from\u201d if everything works correctly), which I made pretty much for <em>RP value + fun + being annoying and WTF my opponent<\/em>.   The basic idea of that deck  (GGR) was  simple \u2013 opponent can\u2019t upkeep with your money flow from assets , you have expensive to bypass ICE which will drain him and make him unable to make runs without MO-ing for 2 complete turns , 7 agendas in 49 cards which will make him come out empty handed really often AND finally a Ruhr Valley+ Caprice combo to really make him want to burn his cards. <\/p>\n\n<p>The initial results made me come to several conclusions: \n1) <strong>The agenda spread was wrong<\/strong>. My opponent was digging like crazy for cards, but holly shit, was I as well! Many times I\u2019d lock him out for 3 turns and I wouldn\u2019t have an agenda to play in them! I took out 2xPriority Req for 3x Medical Breakthrough  and that worked like a miracle! It gave PERFECT pace for the deck. <\/p>\n\n<p>2) The combination of 15+ cards which you can <em>possibly<\/em> install in remotes which you will Diversified Portfolio with is crazy! <\/p>\n\n<p>3) This deck <strong>crushes<\/strong> Account Siphon decks \u2026  I had this game against the top player in our group (and who finished #1 in the Regionals yesterday btw) in which he played Reina, with 3x AS, 3x SoT , 3x Vamp , 3x D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu \u2026. And I got AS-ed 8 times and Vamped 1 or 2 times \u2026. Yet I could still win the game \u2026  That honestly blew me out of my mind and showed me that this deck is the correct choice for the current meta. <\/p>\n\n<p>So \u2026 <em>All<\/em> I had to do is modify the deck a bit, to catch some people off-guard . First I was unhappy a bit with my early game ICE, <strong>so I took out a Ruhr Valley and got in a Hive + pop-up<\/strong> .Second I threw in a <strong>Closed accounts<\/strong> to punish not removing tags Account Siphon-ers and <strong>it worked out great<\/strong>.  That\u2019s why I threw in a <strong>Scorch Earth<\/strong>, that would allow me slap in the face people that are floating tags even harder and <strong>eventually decide games<\/strong>. It worked out superb as well, but  that meant that I had <strong>to take out<\/strong> 1 more Ruhr valley+ Pop-up that I\u2019ve placed earlier.  I put a Data-mine on the place of the Pop-up, because I really wanted to keep the ICE count unchanged and I put <strong>2x Eli<\/strong>, that I really found annoying playing against the day before. <\/p>\n\n<h4><strong>The Tournament:<\/strong>  ( skip if you aren't interested)<\/h4>\n\n<p>My first game was against a Tenma deck with regular breakers and I saw data suckers+ desperado and indexing  being played?? The game was going in wild swings. He started by running in a Komainu in front of HQ on turn 1, discarding AS and other things with his initial hand. That set him back quite a lot.   He was at 4 points I believe and then saw a TFP from R*D which would win him the game. Had Inazuma + Komainu in front of HQ , which for his Ninja+ Yogg+ Data sucker was just too expensive. So he just decided to run me in the hand for TFP with 0 cards in hand \u2026. That\u2019s where the 2 shocks came in play.  I kept them in hand seing  what he would do. Had 2 shocks + TFP + 2 random cards \u2026. On the 4th time he ran in my hand, finally he hit a shock ( the first 3 times he drew TFP and I had to win the Psi-games). <\/p>\n\n<p>Second game was against a MO Siluethe with Notoriety + Quest completed. He was drawing like a madman at the start of the game, I hit some discards \u2026. He eventually end up with 3 quest completed in the discard pile, 1 trashed (by me) SoT  and managed to steal one agenda with a QC. After that I knew my remote was completely safe (with just 2 walls) because of the central-only breakers so I had two things on my mind \u2013 WALL UP CENTRALS and HE HAS 3 NOTORIETY left \u2026  I was at 4 points and he was at 5 I believe, so I was drawing like a madman for an Agenda to put it on my remote. While he was trying to get money. He had 2 floating tags so I Closed Accounts him at 12-14c or so, which made him MO for 2 more \u2026 then I hit the 3 pointer agenda, put it down safely behind the remote and the next turn was crucial. I had a Scorch in hand, which he never saw, but he was at 6 cards in hand \u2026 despite of that I hit the Scorch Earth, knowing that he would go down to 2 cards and I had 2 shocks in my archives, which he needs to access for the Notoriety and I knew he would need time to draw somewhere.  So I SE, double advance \u2026 and with the scorch I hit 2 out of the 3 notoriety left in the game =) which won me the game. <\/p>\n\n<p>This Is getting long so I will be really short on the next ones.  Third game was against  Chaos Theory. Mulligan into no ICE for 3 turns, he steals 5 early. I finally setup, score 4 points, start working and then I make the mistake to put a naked Medical Breakthrough in ONE out of my EIGHT remotes, at least half of which are face down.  I didn\u2019t put it behind a 2 ICE server, because he would just barely get in \u2026 and I bluffed by putting that and one other card before it in naked remotes. He exposed the second one ( rightfully so, because I took like 2-3min thinking if I should put it) , ran and GG. Totally my mistake<\/p>\n\n<p>Last game was against a Chaos Theory again, he took out early MO and spend the entirety of his first couple of turns wasting clicks trashing my assets (some with Encryption protocol) while I was setting up ICE and getting money. Drew into 2 Shinobi, put one down and behind it Medical Breakthrough. He puts down a Femme, femms it and runs there. With 2 money left, He can\u2019t bypass cuz he needs 3, he can\u2019t break any subroutines and dies. Simply, he didn\u2019t expect me to play Shinobi (which is the point of the card in the deck). <\/p>\n\n<h4><strong>A few last notes that worth reading:<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>The Economy of this deck is crazy. Diversified Portfolio is a great card. At first I wanted to DP ( :D ) only for 8+ credits on 9 remotes\u2026. <strong>But then I realized that it easily replaces Hedge Fund or Beanstalk in different points of the game<\/strong> (and sometimes even better than them) in <em>this<\/em> particular deck. <\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Reclamation order<\/strong> is great for this deck. Having the option to <strong>pick up ALL of your Sundews  or MHC<\/strong> after they\u2019ve spent ages trying to trash them is great \u2013 OR all of your <strong>Diversified Portfolios which you played for 3-4c<\/strong> before setup all of your crazy count remotes.  Also works to pick up your <strong>Scorch for Game winners<\/strong>.  <\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Tenma is a <strong>brilliant<\/strong> card against single focus decks.  Being able to make the most expensive Run for 1 turn in any point of time and not to mention completely countering Escher \u2026. For 1-2 card slots, also in this deck buffing your Diversified Portfolio while doing it \u2013 absolutely yes. <\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>I saw Ruhr Valley only once during the tournament and Akitaro never. However, I kept them in the deck, because I wanted to have more consitency on my Diversified Portfolio. <\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Eli didn't do as much work as expected. <\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<h4><strong>Final changes that I will make to this deck:<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n<p>Take out 1x Ruhr Valley + 1x Elli 1.0 for <strong>2nd Scorch<\/strong>. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Put 2x Cerebral Casting<\/strong> to be able to tag decks that don\u2019t run Account Siphon =) <\/p>\n\n<h4><strong>Why the name??<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n<p>The name is because what most people would expect from a hard on assets (even encryption protocols) is a traplles or simply taxing Jinteki.  Where as we will run our sneaky attacks via Shinobi , Scorches and sometimes even Shocks!  A perfect marketing campaign! ;) <\/p>\n\n<p>As always feel free to leave questions if you have any, while I moderate the text a bit.<\/p>\n","username":"Dydra","cards":{"01076":1,"01079":1,"01084":1,"01099":1,"01106":1,"02029":3,"02031":1,"02110":2,"02111":1,"04013":1,"04020":1,"04054":3,"04073":3,"04074":2,"04093":1,"04111":1,"04114":3,"04115":2,"05005":3,"05006":1,"05007":3,"05009":3,"05012":1,"05016":2,"05017":2,"05018":2,"05020":1,"05026":3}},{"id":7240,"name":"Whizzard's Magic Yellow Killer","creation":"2014-06-30 10:25:49","description":"<p>The point of this deck is to lock down FA decks by denying them money and cards using whizzard credits, imping combo peices and ripping through ice.

A lot of people question its usefulness without Parasite, but I've been happy with it.<\/p>\n","username":"frolic","cards":{"01002":2,"01004":1,"01007":1,"01011":1,"01012":3,"01018":2,"01050":3,"01053":3,"02007":1,"02009":2,"02021":1,"02042":3,"02103":3,"03052":2,"03054":3,"04009":3,"04041":1,"04042":3,"04043":3,"05036":2,"05053":3}},{"id":7245,"name":"LXC #4 (corp)","creation":"2014-06-30 15:50:15","description":"\n","username":"Ragnarook","cards":{"01062":2,"01065":2,"01068":3,"01078":3,"02029":3,"02031":1,"02039":1,"03008":2,"03025":2,"03027":2,"04013":3,"04054":3,"04060":3,"04074":3,"04091":2,"04115":2,"05006":1,"05007":3,"05009":3,"05018":3,"05026":3}},{"id":7246,"name":"LXC #4 (runner)","creation":"2014-06-30 15:51:31","description":"\n","username":"Ragnarook","cards":{"01026":1,"01034":3,"02027":1,"02047":3,"02050":2,"02066":1,"02106":2,"02107":1,"03030":1,"03034":3,"03035":1,"03038":3,"03040":1,"03044":1,"03045":1,"03046":3,"04002":3,"04022":2,"04027":2,"04042":3,"04047":1,"04067":1,"04107":3,"04109":3}},{"id":7247,"name":"Run Like an Antelope Criminal","creation":"2014-06-30 16:32:22","description":"\n","username":"The Archon","cards":{"01007":2,"01018":2,"01019":2,"01021":2,"01022":2,"01024":2,"01027":1,"01039":2,"01050":2,"01053":2,"02006":1,"02009":2,"02043":2,"02069":2,"02091":2,"02105":2,"03046":1,"03052":2,"04024":2,"04044":2,"04089":2,"04108":2,"05029":1,"05032":2,"05035":2}},{"id":7248,"name":"Net Dead Yet","creation":"2014-06-30 16:40:29","description":"\n","username":"The Archon","cards":{"01068":3,"01069":2,"01070":2,"01075":2,"01077":2,"01078":2,"01090":2,"01098":3,"01109":2,"02014":2,"02031":1,"02032":3,"02112":2,"03026":2,"03027":2,"04012":3,"04039":2,"04054":2,"04074":2,"05006":1,"05017":2,"05024":2}},{"id":7249,"name":"Moocher v.7","creation":"2014-06-30 17:24:46","description":"<p>Get your efficient breakers on Personal Workshop and then run and use the credits from the rezzed ice or a well timed Stim Hack to get your breaker suite out.

Clone Retirement doesn't even have to sit on the board, as you can play it straight from hand.  The Future Perfect is mostly meant to suck up some agenda points.  I have no plans to ever install it, which is good since it defends itself while in HQ, Archives, or R&amp;D.<\/p>\n\n<p>Assets:\nAll non-advance all the time!  People get very confused by an installed Snare!  Everything here is great.  Sundews are perfect RP econ.<\/p>\n\n<p>Ops:\nJust some econ stuff, though showing your opponent a handful of traps and an agenda (especially The Future Perfect) is pretty fun.<\/p>\n\n<p>Ice:\nI usually balance my numbers out here a lot more but I really felt like the sentries were going to do exactly what I wanted.  Taxing all around but with enough stuff to actually end runs.  This is definitely where most of the bigger changes will happen.  I will probably try to change the expensive ice to something more affordable but that does the same job.  I also have influence to spare and can use it here.<\/p>\n\n<p>That's it.  Just lay out a ton of traps and see what happens.  I've played one game with it so far and I got the Runner to completely diminish her stack with only one card in hand.

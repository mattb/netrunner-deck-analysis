The idea here is to have a huge MU to host tons of programs, all of which include at least two copies of each with accompanying resources for econ. In the mid game you can really tutor quickly by capstoning with at least 2 (though frequently 3) cards you already have installed. Cloak, Dagger, and Silencer ensure that you can face check most things early as you build your rig, while paintbrush pairs nicely with any of the three breakers featured, and with no shortage of ways to make money you can amass quite a bank account to hack almost any server. This is a tried and true shaper deck that shows a normal shaper early game but accelerates quickly in the mid game. Sure it could replace a few things or add SMC, but I find a lot of the tutoring cards take away from Mac's ability. Capstone can be really fast and cheap producing a faster draw rate than a drawn diesel.

Nothing special for a criminal deck, but now we have 17 influence, which allows us to play that extra Maker's Eye or whatever plus Ken pays you for every Dirty Laundry, Indexing, Inside Job, etc. With Prepaid VoicePAD and Desperado all of these things are virtually for free. With Sneakdoor we get into HQ even when the Corp. puts thousands of Ice in front of it. Icebreakers plus Datasucker are also self-explanatory.

The basic concept is to sit tight and advance things for a long long time, preferably using Simone Diego to do it for free. Back then it also used Matrix Analyzer etc. to do funky stuff, but recently I've found that there is simply too much I want in the deck to keep them, and since Simone is integral to the design, a lot of influence is already used up by her.<\/p>\n\n<p>The basic principal is to install something and advance it twice. Next turn you install something (to get your free credit) or whatever you feel like and advance the previous card twice again. And again. And again. Until you either score it, make a ton of cash or install something over it. If Simone is out, sometimes it's even worth it to keep advancing a \"failed\" trap just to establish the routine of keep advancing the cards.<\/p>\n\n<p>The deck has a lot of leeway for personal touches. Currently I'm testing out the GRNDL Refinery, and Corporate Troubleshooter in the deck and am quite happy with them. Especially the troubleshooter as you often sit on a pile of creds.<\/p>\n\n<p>Scoring a Mandatory Upgrades is obviously good, but overscoring Project Ares is incredible. If you get off to a good start, Project Ares can almost reset the runner, and you can build up another one while he or she establishes themselves again.\nOverscoring Vitruvius is obviously also really good. Allows you to use the counters in a Jackson way (using the Archives as a resting spot of agendas), recurring whatever you need the most. Lost ICE, money boosts etc.<\/p>\n\n<p>The ICE selection is based on ETR, taxing and Atman-proof. Guess the basics of the deck was constructed when Atman was high. This can easily be changed according to local meta or preferance - but you want to have your remote somewhat taxing to go through, as well as your R&amp;D. Sometimes also HQ, depending on how vulnerable you feel.<\/p>\n\n<p>H&amp;P Update:\nRemoved 1x Simone Diego and 1x GRNDL Refinery\nAdded 2x NeoTokyo Grid<\/p>\n\n<p>The GRNDL Ref gave a huge econ boost if you got it through, but the NeoTokyo is kinda like a weaker but cheaper Simone that is harder to trash and also works together with Simone for even more synergy. There are still plenty of advanceable non-Agendas.<\/p>\n","username":"aermet69","cards":{"01054":1,"01056":3,"01057":2,"01061":2,"01062":1,"01063":1,"01064":1,"01065":2,"01090":1,"01103":2,"01110":3,"01113":1,"02011":3,"02013":1,"02051":3,"02060":1,"02092":3,"02099":2,"02110":1,"03009":1,"03012":2,"03017":1,"03019":1,"04010":3,"04071":1,"04096":1,"04099":1,"04100":1,"04119":1,"04120":1,"05021":2}},{"id":5305,"name":"Wayland Rush Down","creation":"2014-05-08 17:15:15","description":"<p>A single server deck built for massive cash flow, just keep the runner out while you score away no subtlety required and the odd snare to punish them on R&amp;D \/ HQ runs.<\/p>\n","username":"Pinkwarrior","cards":{"01059":1,"01070":2,"01083":2,"01090":1,"01093":1,"01094":3,"01098":3,"01101":1,"01102":1,"01103":3,"01110":3,"01111":3,"01113":1,"02018":3,"02019":3,"02070":3,"02120":3,"03026":1,"03027":2,"04017":2,"04080":1,"04100":1,"05024":2}},{"id":5306,"name":"Sonic the Grifter","creation":"2014-05-08 17:15:56","description":"\n","username":"pleaix","cards":{"01004":1,"01007":2,"01008":3,"01014":2,"01018":3,"01021":2,"01022":2,"01024":3,"01036":2,"02009":2,"02104":2,"02106":1,"03052":3,"03054":2,"04009":2,"04046":3,"05029":1,"05032":2,"05035":2,"05036":2,"05041":2,"05048":2}},{"id":5307,"name":"My Kit Deck","creation":"2014-05-08 17:24:58","description":"\n","username":"samisafish69","cards":{"01004":2,"01007":1,"01008":1,"01011":1,"01012":1,"01014":1,"01026":1,"01034":2,"01035":3,"01043":1,"01050":3,"02047":3,"02048":1,"02091":3,"02107":3,"03028":1,"03031":1,"03034":3,"03038":2,"03044":2,"03046":3,"03052":2,"03053":3,"04108":2}},{"id":5308,"name":"Operation Overmind","creation":"2014-05-08 17:33:00","description":"<p>my version of the high MU overmind recursion deck thats going around<\/p>\n","username":"CodeMarvelous","cards":{"01005":3,"01011":1,"01033":1,"01034":3,"01044":1,"01047":1,"01050":3,"02024":2,"02047":3,"02068":2,"02088":3,"03034":3,"03035":2,"03038":3,"03049":1,"04004":2,"04042":3,"04066":3,"04086":3,"05053":3}},{"id":5309,"name":"Exiled Overmind","creation":"2014-05-08 17:53:24","description":"<p>Just a fun deck with a simple idea - play Overmind as your \"only\" breaker\/installed program (3 power counters, or 4 when installed on Omni-Drive) and try and make it more efficient with the e3FeedBack Implants. \nOnce your Overmind is out of power, pawn it to Aesop's or Scavenge for itself for extra buttkicking for goodness.<\/p>\n\n<p>Grappling Hook there for the obvious synergy with e3, and Deus X\/Sharpshooter cause they're great disposable breakers...<\/p>\n\n<p>( ???

It really requires a switch in play.<\/p>\n\n<p>I built this deck with 2 things in mind: Recurring credits and cheap\/efficient breakers.<\/p>\n\n<p>Faerie is by far the most efficient sentry breaker and is free to install. Use sacrificial constructs to keep it in play. Clone Chips can also be used to bring it back.<\/p>\n\n<p>Corroder is kind of a no brainer. Super efficient and also quite cheap.\nGordian blade is still doubtful though. It's pretty expensive. I might trade it in for a ZU. On the other side though, Gordian does keep it's strength throughout the run, so it saves you creds.<\/p>\n\n<p>Toolbox is something really expensive to put in a deck like this, but I find the extra MU and recurring creds very useful. Also the 2 extra link will help against traces (need to try and get every econ boost I can find). You could use Kati to bank up the money. Same goes for ProCo. Really expensive, but I think will help the deck in the long run. The extra MU may seem overkill at first glance, but I predict Bad Times will become a pretty popular card, so having MU to spare will be a very good thing in the future.<\/p>\n\n<p>Easy Mark and Social Engineering are there for small econ boosts. Social Engineering is made for Nasir. You just double up your credit pool which gives you loads of breathing room. Same with Personal Workshop, just put a program on there and chill or rush it out when needed.<\/p>\n\n<p>Use Scavenge to put your programs on Omni-Drive if you haven't drawn any in the beginning.<\/p>\n\n<p>Crescentus is kind of a wild card.

Once all of that is in place you can start cycling through traps, assets, agendas in that remote.  If you get to that point it can become quite taxing and\/or impossible for the runner to check everything in your remote and if they do check everything they probably take some damage and maybe end up tagged at some point.<\/p>\n\n<p>The Adonis and Eve campaigns can be played in the open, but only get rezzed when the runner can't immediately trash them, or if they are trashing everything then you have to give them some defence.  An early Gila's Hands is amazing, if you slip one through early you are set, it's way better than scoring one of the 3 for 2 agendas.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Most of the time you play things never advance style, which is why the 3-2 agendas instead of the sentinel defence agenda, however if you install advance advance it could either be the Wotan or a cerebral so sometimes you can push the runner into making a match point situation if you already have 4 points.<\/p>\n\n<p>The ice performed pretty well, its a mix of etr and taxing, but I think it could probably be improved.  I avoided any illicit ice, because in a long game the bad publicity can be killer.  Also, the ice is quite vanilla, so as not to tip the runner off that something other than a taxing hb build is going on.<\/p>\n\n<p>The deck is actually a revisit to an old deck I made to use Isabel McGuire when she was released, and last minute I decided to play a revised version since I thought it would catch people out.  Unfortunately for Izzy, she isn't very good so she got cut and replaced with archived memories. This supported the other major difference from that list, which was replacing a ronin with a scorched earth, so now I could potentially double scorch.  Dropping ronin for scorch seemed to be a really good idea as the deck went from ok, to actually being dangerous.  The idea actually wasn't to build an hb scorch deck, I was just annoyed by people indiscriminately going tag me against HB and found closed accounts wasn't quite cutting it as tag punishment, since I only get 1 or 2 of them and they can have 6 or more siphons.<\/p>\n\n<p>Not sure how well it will work if people know what you are up to, but as a change-up pitch it can definitely catch people out.<\/p>\n","username":"Garbo","cards":{"01054":1,"01055":3,"01056":3,"01058":2,"01061":1,"01062":2,"01064":2,"01070":3,"01099":1,"01108":1,"01110":3,"01111":1,"01113":2,"02051":3,"02052":2,"02053":1,"02092":3,"02110":3,"03006":2,"03009":2,"03015":1,"03017":1,"03019":1,"03023":2,"04015":3,"04120":1}},{"id":6799,"name":"Toronto HT Regionals 2014 (3rd Place) Runner","creation":"2014-06-15 17:18:34","description":"<p>No nonsense criminal build, this exact list is tweaked a little bit to help against glacier RP and HB decks but otherwise is pretty standard.<\/p>\n\n<p>41 person tournament <a href=\"http:\/\/www.boardgamegeek.com\/thread\/1188070\/1st-place-toronto-regionals-hairy-tarantula-north\">Winners report on bgg<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>Record in Swiss: 5-1<\/p>\n\n<p>Record in Elims: 1-1<\/p>\n\n<p>Derived from the <a href=\"http:\/\/stimhack.com\/regionals-victoria-canada-23-players\/\">Victoria Regionals winning decklist<\/a>.\nI had been testing wacky criminal builds and none of them worked, so I went with something that felt close to standard no nonsense criminal.

Runs not played through a card are meant to be probing runs to see what kind of ice they have or to load up data sucker. You should and will face check with this deck. Early game is meant for checking everything out, install the necessary breakers and go. Prepaid VoicePad is great in this deck. Once you have one or 2 installed most events are really cheap and Sure Gamble\/Lucky Find threshold becomes really low (playing lucky find for free feels really good). <\/p>\n\n<p>I think most of the cards in this deck are self explanatory. 3x Crash Space is a recent addition. It used to be 3x Plascrete, but I think Crash Space might be more useful as floating tags doesn't only mean meat damage in the coming meta (tag me decks are going to become less popular).

With this ID, sometimes, you're gonna need to bring back expensive ice, and re-install it elsewhere. If you can score this early, do so. It will give you a huge advantage when you don't have to pay the install costs. <\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"\/en\/card\/06071\">Hades Fragment<\/a> Kind of unrelated, but I just feel like it's a good counter to some Noise shenanigans. Noise mills agendas into your trash? Just put them at the bottom of your R&amp;D.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"\/en\/card\/01094\">Hostile Takeover<\/a>: Easy money, and archer bait.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"\/en\/card\/01106\">Priority Requisition<\/a>: Hello yes, I'd like to rez a Curtain wall for free, and net 14 credits for it. Oh, Priority Req? Thanks.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"\/en\/card\/02018\">Project Atlas<\/a>: Just general scoring card. 3\/2.<\/p>\n\n<p>Assets:<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"\/en\/card\/01056\">Adonis Campaign<\/a>: With this ID you can use Adonis as a mini-beanstalk. Install, rez at the end of the runner's turn, take it back to your hand for a net of 3. Also cool: You can rez, let it run out until the second to last turn of it, take it back for 4 and play it again.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"\/en\/card\/04015\">Jackson Howard<\/a>: Jackson, nuff said.<\/p>\n\n<p>Upgrade:<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"\/en\/card\/02038\">Amazon Industrial Zone<\/a>: Synergy with the ID. Install a card, rez for 3 less. Need to move a Curtain wall somewhere?

Also, with the new anarch resource, you can now econ up to prepare for that 2-6credits for purging viruses.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"\/en\/card\/01110\">Hedge Fund<\/a>: Standard Econ<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"\/en\/card\/02079\">Oversight AI<\/a>: Best card for this ID, In my opinion.

Refractor really changed Kit's game and Astrolabe and Switchblade only make it better.  This is a Pseudo Big Rig Efficiency deck that happens to be pretty easy to set up since Kit really only needs a single Refractor to be ready to roll.<\/p>\n\n<p>The idea is to get in efficiently and cheap.  Refractor is an insane decoder that's quick to install early and stays relevant.  If you start with an opening hand of any stealth credit (Lockpick\/Cloak\/Ghost Runner) and Refractor or SMC, no early game ICE is going to stop you.<\/p>\n\n<p>The most recent changes are switching BOX-E for Astrolabe and cutting Dagger for Switchblade (the +2 Influence from getting rid of BOX-E and using that towards Switchblade was perfect).  Losing BOX-E makes this deck a lot more unsafe from Scorched and Jinteki, and losing the 1 console memory can be big, but Astrolabe makes the deck a lot faster.  An opening hand with Astrolabe is hard to ignore.  Even if the rest is garbage, mind who your opponent is and decide if they're likely to play a horizontal game.<\/p>\n\n<p>Paintbrush is in the deck for when you're facing giant servers, but it's probably not needed most of the time.  The only reason such a situational card is still in the deck is because it goes so well with Kit and it can be an absolute game-changer.<\/p>\n\n<p>Leprechaun has been pulling its weight as a great memory alternative.  Leprechaun is for housing Magnum Opus, Paintbrush, and any of your SMC's.  It's basically paying 2 credits for 3 memory.  After getting rid of BOX-E, I threw in a one-off of Cybersolutions Mem Chip for safety, and with Omnidrive, memory has rarely been a problem.<\/p>\n\n<p>Early game economy is important!  Later on, you'll be running efficiently with tons of recurring credits, but in the opening stages, getting your rig installed as you run with Refractor gets expensive.  Honestly, an opening hand with Magnum Opus alone is worth it because you'll be set for the rest of the game.<\/p>\n\n<p>Overall, this is a fun deck that is unstoppable if you get equipped with your essentials early on.  It has a number of strong opening hands, and once it's set up, it can get anywhere without a hassle.<\/p>\n","username":"BreadRising","cards":{"01026":1,"01034":2,"01044":2,"01050":3,"02047":2,"02091":2,"02107":3,"03028":1,"03034":2,"03038":1,"03039":2,"03041":3,"03046":3,"04006":3,"04086":1,"04108":1,"05035":2,"06019":2,"06040":3,"06053":1,"06057":3,"06077":1,"06079":2}},{"id":9855,"name":"Domestic Counterstrike Ver: 0.2","creation":"2014-10-17 04:48:50","description":"<p>Runner needs to steal 9 points to win, you need 6 + <a href=\"\/en\/card\/06001\">Domestic Sleepers<\/a>.

I have found it strong in the current meta as it provides strong counterplays against:<\/p>\n\n<p>a) Parasite owing to the presence of Lotus Field which I have found all round to be a fantastic central\/scoring remote piece of ICE. Also having quite a lot of low cost:decent strength ICE makes parasite less problematic (also lag time\/encrypted means i can often buff parasited ICE to keep it alive for one or two turns)<\/p>\n\n<p>b) Fixed breakers\/Atman owing to the presence of Encrypted + Lag time which means your ice strength will fluctuate throughout the game<\/p>\n\n<p>Generally speaking Neo-Tokyo Grid has been a very strong card here, synergising well with the ID (you can place the Tennin tokens directly on Neo Tokyo to gain a cred and create an expensive to trash TOL bank). <\/p>\n\n<p>The grail ice were a recent sub for 3 x ice wall and a surprise ICHI 2.0 (as a one of ICHI 2.0 can be a brutal game winner).

With House of Knives and Mamba you'll accumulate net damage tokens to turn them into brain damage with ms. Hanzo.<\/p>\n\n<p>To complement with this, Cerebral Cast and Schorched Earth will gives a lot of  opening to kill the runner whether or not he has been brain damaged before.<\/p>\n\n<p>One another good point that people might not have realize with Nisei Division is that the ID ability can also be use as a simple economic boost. With 3x Snare!, 3x Fetal AI and 3x The Future Perfect, you can let the runner go through when you feel it's safe by choosing 0 credits on the Psy game. You'll gain 1 credits each time you do that. It make every psy ICE to act like just like the Pop-up Window passive ability.<\/p>\n\n<p>Edge of World is powerful here as people expect a lot more Cerebral Overwriter and you only have one in the deck so there is not many chance they are going to see it coming.<\/p>\n","username":"Exo","cards":{"01070":3,"01099":3,"01110":3,"02015":3,"02032":3,"02053":1,"02073":3,"04012":3,"04013":1,"04015":3,"04093":3,"04114":3,"05002":1,"05004":3,"05006":1,"05007":3,"05013":3,"05017":2,"05022":2,"06065":3}},{"id":9869,"name":"NBN Tag and Bag","creation":"2014-10-17 16:15:24","description":"<p>A first attempt at an NBN fast-advance deck with a tag and bag kicker.

With Nasir's ability you immediately have credits to bring ICE down to zero strength with Wyrm, to insta-destroy upon rez.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Having enough money is the crux, since killing with Wyrm costs 2x strength of ICE - 1.  Suckers help a lot as does the virus counter you get on Parasite from Grimoire (bring the cost down by 2 for each virus counter).  Ghost runner and Net Celebrity are your other options for making up the difference.  Archer is the worst (7 extra credits necessary after getting the Nasir money), while  Janus pays for itself to die.  You gain profit from killing Tsurugi. <\/p>\n\n<p>Note that if you have Grimoire out you can insta-parasite any 0 or 1 strength  ICE and kill after rez but before encounter which prevents Nasir from losing all his money (but also prevents him from gaining, so for something like Komainu you want to insta-parasite after encounter).<\/p>\n\n<p>You can insta-parasite with Clone chips, SMC's, or Parasites on Personal Workshop.<\/p>\n\n<p>Strategy of this particular flavor of Nasir the Destroyer is to get out Replicator early, use it to get all your Clone chips out, and use a copy of the Replicator to Trade-in for Grimoire.   Destroy all the ICE you can, then Levy to renew Clone chips and Parasites.  If you can install an SMC before you Levy, that can help keep up the momentum.  <\/p>\n\n<p>This deck can be fun, but very fiddly.

[{"id":9247,"name":"Getting Nasir the End","creation":"2014-09-05 02:00:16","description":"<p>Publishing this deck not because it's good or it worked, but because I like some of the ideas, and maybe someone else can get more mileage from them than I can. <\/p>\n\n<p>The idea here was that Nasir wants the corp to rez ICE. This get's him money, slows the corp, is good. Using Alpha and Omega means that you'd have to install ICE three deep to keep him out, meaning that Nasir gets that much more money from his ability. Their high install cost is subsidized by PW and early gains, and Femme can take care of the central ICE. Trashing ICE also keeps the servers thin and the corp scrambling to keep you out. Datasuckers offset the breakers' low strength, and Cloak and Toolbox provide recurring funds. ProCo helps you get econ while drawing the full rig. <\/p>\n\n<p>The main problem is that Alpha and Omega are EXPENSIVE. Even once you get set up, you're paying an arm and a leg to get in. Nasir is good at getting set up, but not so good at maintaining constant runs, which is why big rig works well with him. If A and O had lower install costs and just helped in the early game, or a higher strength as to not be hideously expensive, this might work. As it is, it's not particularly strong.<\/p>\n","username":"Thike","cards":{"01004":1,"01008":3,"01009":1,"01012":2,"01026":2,"01041":2,"02003":1,"02009":2,"02049":3,"02066":1,"02090":1,"02091":2,"02107":3,"03034":3,"03038":3,"03041":3,"03046":2,"03048":1,"03049":3,"04067":1,"04087":3,"04088":3,"06017":1}},{"id":9248,"name":"The Chairman","creation":"2014-09-05 02:15:23","description":"<p>When I saw <a href=\"\/en\/card\/05008\">Chairman Hiro<\/a> I was intrigued by his high risk but powerful effect.

In RP, this works by placing a Ruhr and a Caprice down into a remote (perhaps protected by 1 or 2 pieces of taxing ice to make trashing them prohibitively expensive). A run into that server will cost 3 clicks, thus giving the runner only one chance to beat Caprice. If a Nisei MKII has been scored, its token can be used immediately after losing the psi game with Caprice to just say \"no\".<\/p>\n\n<p>RP does particularly excel at this strategy, though I believe it is feasible to pull off the same play in HB. Having ELP in play turns our box into RP, combined with a Ruhr costs the same 3 clicks to run. We can turn them down with either Caprice or Ash and end the run. If we are unable to have an ELP in play, we can just build a larger 'bento box' by using Ash, Caprice, and Ruhr all together. The runner would use the first 2 clicks to break Ash, and would then have to get through Caprice in just one run. ELP is thus very important for us, though not completely necessary, as it can't always be counted on. <\/p>\n\n<p>One advantage that HB packs over Jinteki, however, is having some of the beefiest ice available to corps. Bioroids are generally more efficient than the ice of other corps, balanced by being able to be clicked through. Clicking through ice to access remotes is, fortunately for us, quite impossible when we're set up. Add in the extra tax presented by HB: Stronger Together and our ice is just plain superior. Biotic Efficiency Research helps rez some of the bigger pieces of ice, which should serve to either create a very early scoring window or give us extra wiggle room in the early game by throwing a turn one Wotan down on HQ.<\/p>\n","username":"StitchInTime","cards":{"01055":1,"01056":3,"01063":3,"01106":3,"01110":3,"02010":1,"02012":1,"02013":2,"02092":3,"02110":3,"02111":3,"03006":1,"03013":3,"03015":2,"03016":1,"03017":1,"03019":3,"04015":3,"04030":1,"04114":3,"04119":3,"06022":3}},{"id":9261,"name":"Running with Corrosive Knives 1.1","creation":"2014-09-05 15:38:50","description":"<p>Your goal is to get DinoBlade with Magnum Opus funding everything by the end of turn 3.<\/p>\n\n<p>Your starting hand MUST have a code gate breaker + Magnum Opus OR one of those &amp; Test Run to tutor for what is missing.

Special Order, Test Run, and SMC are primarily for finding stuff; the latter two are aimed at getting the Opus, if I don't draw it. <\/p>\n\n<p>I just recently added Djinn+Medium+Nerve Agent, with the idea being that it helps tutor even more. It's worked well so far, but again, I've not played it competitively. One main drawback I had before was that I just couldn't dig for enough cards. I don't yet have R&amp;D Interface or Indexing), and the thought is that this can help me dig for more cards when I get through.<\/p>\n\n<p>Dino and Personal Touch are to help push stuff up higher. Dino CAN be used to negate the 2 MU of Opus too, but I try to not do that. More on that later.<\/p>\n\n<p>Scavenge is mostly for two things:<\/p>\n\n<p>1) Re-summon the Femme to change her target (I thought of changing to Cyber Cypher for this same use)<\/p>\n\n<p>2) Re-summon something if I get one of the Dino's after I already put out a good breaker. I love to put Yog on it, but Femme works well too. <\/p>\n\n<p>3) (okay, 3 things, but this one barely counts) Summon something OFF of Dinosaurus to it can be free to host something better<\/p>\n\n<p>4) (okay, really, the last one) Resummon Atma at a different strength. But I generally prefer to start low on this and use Personal Touches to raise it. But it sucks when someone uses an upgrade that raises the strength of ice right after getting Atma out there knowing what they had.<\/p>\n","username":"mjortman","cards":{"01007":1,"01009":1,"01010":1,"01014":1,"01022":2,"01026":1,"01034":3,"01035":2,"01036":3,"01040":2,"01044":1,"01049":3,"01050":3,"02041":1,"02046":1,"02047":3,"02048":2,"03034":3,"03039":1,"03040":1,"03046":2,"03052":3}},{"id":9266,"name":"Dec@Day.05 - Watching Out For You","creation":"2014-09-05 17:07:58","description":"<p><em><strong>Dec@Day<\/strong> - Every identity, one day and deck at a time.

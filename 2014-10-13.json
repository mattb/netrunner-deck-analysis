In fact I usually dedicate my first SMC to making sure Mopus hits the table; not only does it set up a devastating economic potential, but it's your Scorch\/Midseasons protection in a deck that just doesn't have time for Plascrete. That makes it all the more important to realize the healthy mix of blazing speed you can achieve needs to be tempered with economic patience. The more money you have, the less the corp can do to you. There are usually one or two money-making turns you should be able to identify in most games, wherein you should feel comfortable letting off server pressure and clicking Mopus for 8 credits; in much the same way corps identify scoring windows, your win rate with this deck will skyrocket when you can start to identify economy windows.<\/p>\n\n<p>This build isn't wildly different from the first version of Hard Stealth Kit that inspired it. The second copy of Magnum Opus is out, which can put a little more weight on your Clone Chips' shoulders should it get trashed, but since I consistently SMC out the Mopus, drawing into the second was always a disappointment.

Any good Weyland deck wants to beat you into the ground with its bank account, and Blue Sun is maybe the best fit of this philosophy we've seen yet.<\/p>\n\n<p>This deck packs 19 pieces of taxing or flat out gargantuan ice, but it's not content to sit back and wait for you to try and crack through. Your goal here is to score out an over-advanced Atlas as early as possible, and if you get two power counters on it, you're in a beautiful spot. Because once you've built up your taxing remote and the money to defend it (both easy with Blue Sun), it's time for you to find and install the star of this deck: your SanSan. And now the fun begins.<\/p>\n\n<p>You've over-advanced your Atlas, and you have a SanSan rezzed behind several pieces of heavy ice that you've now shifted over from various places around the board. You know what this means right? That Atlas essentially becomes Weyland's version of an AstroScript that can search for itself. Pull an Atlas from the deck, install-advance-advance. It's a 2\/2 agenda. It doesn't refresh itself with a counter like Astro, but that's ok. Your defenses are more than taxing enough to wait for more agendas to come down the pipeline. And don't be afraid to Atlas out the SanSan either, especially if you know you <em>don't<\/em> have a safe scoring window. Pull it from R&amp;D with a counter, stick something else in a remote, and watch as the runner spends all their money making what they think is a power play. You control the economic pace with this deck.<\/p>\n\n<p>And because of that need to be the one holding the purse strings, you'll notice there's no bad pub here. No Grim, no Frackings, no Hostiles, and yes that means no Archer. But it doesn't matter. Sure, the runner will never hit anything nasty, but what they do hit, they'll need money to break. Lots of money. And if they do have the money to break into your servers, will they be able to pay 4 credits to steal the NAPD you put down? If they can pay 4 to steal the NAPD, will they have enough left to survive the SEA Scorch you pulled from your deck with Atlas after you get 8 credits from the Tollbooth they paid so much to run through?<\/p>\n\n<p>Yes, D4v1d is a quite appropriately a weakness to this deck. Before you Oversight your Curtain Wall to gain 14 credits at the start of your next turn, you'll need to consider the likelihood of them dropping a D4v1d and breaking it. It's best if you can protect it behind a dinky piece of ice like Datapike or Ice Wall so they can't snipe your burst economy ice right after you drop it.<\/p>\n\n<p>This deck is still in its infancy but I've had a lot of early success with it out of the gate.

I modified that deck for U.S. Nationals, and it helped me take 18th place there. I haven't played it much since then, but I updated it again with Currents and took it to the semi-monthly Game Night Kit tournament at Centerville's Epic Loot Comics &amp; Games (Cincinnati\/Dayton meta). I ended up taking 1st place against two Replicating Perfections and two Core Jintekis (three wins, one timed tie against a Core Jinteki).<\/p>\n\n<p>Notable changes from the original Same Old Andy include using Passport as the sole Decoder. I needed something to deal with Lotus Fields at Nationals, and its cheap cost really helps with early pressure. If I have to get into a remote protected by a Code Gate, I have Inside Jobs, Emergency Shutdowns, and a Femme Fatale. The deck's success at Nationals convinced me it was alright to cut my Mimic to get one extra influence, replacing it with Alias. After all, I have those same solutions for Sentries on remotes, along with Femme Fatale's Sentry-breaking and Faeries.<\/p>\n\n<p>I needed the extra influence to add two Net Celebrities so I could deal with Enhanced Login Protocols and a Manhunt deck I expected at the tournament. I chose Crash Space instead of Plascretes to deal with Account Siphon tags, Snare tags, potential Manhunt tags, and meat damage if it came to that. There's not too much Scorched Earth going on outside of Personal Evolution decks in our area (nor Midseasons decks currently), but someone was playing a Stronger Together Punitive Counterstrike deck at the last tournament<\/p>\n\n<p>The deck has 46 cards because I added the Net Celebrities the night before the tournament, and I had no idea what to cut and no time to test it out. I probably should have cut Kati Jones since I never felt the need to install her during the tournament, but she saved me two or three times at Nationals. I also would have liked to add John Masanori back in for facing Personal Evolutions. Net Celebrity is great for helping make runs efficient, and turning me into a Whizzard-level trashing threat with Scrubber.<\/p>\n\n<p>If you're unfamiliar with the original, one of the deck's key strengths is the ability to Test Run the Femme Fatale on HQ ICE, Account Siphon, then trash tags in a single turn. Test Run is also handy for recovering a breaker that you might have lost. I didn't use Test Run once during this tournament, but it's come in handy a lot of times before. I've seen a nice variation that also uses Keyhole.<\/p>\n","username":"ekayohlee","cards":{"01007":1,"01008":3,"01018":3,"01021":2,"01022":3,"01024":3,"01026":1,"01030":2,"01050":3,"02043":2,"02047":1,"02063":1,"02083":1,"02091":1,"02104":2,"02107":2,"03052":3,"03054":3,"04004":2,"05035":2,"05041":1,"05046":1,"05048":2,"06038":2}},{"id":9716,"name":"Striving for Perfection v3 1st Place (FY14 Revised Guidance)","creation":"2014-10-13 17:58:17","description":"<h1>Jinteki Announces Improved Growth Forecast and Revised Guidance<\/h1>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Jinteki revised its earnings guidance upward for the fiscal year following its success at U.S. Nationals and a recent Game Night Kit tournament win at Centerville's Epic Loot Games &amp; Comics (11 competitors, Cincinnat\/Dayton meta).<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Implementing Current technology has enabled Jinteki to accelerate the company's growth, as well as better protect its assets and agendas.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>The company has increased efforts to mitigate damages and threats from the recent rash of dangerous anarchists terrorizing servers.<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>NEW ANGELES, ECUADOR--(NBN WIRE)-- Jinteki Corporation (JNTK) today announced an improved growth forecast and revised guidance for its fiscal year. Coming off <a href=\"http:\/\/netrunnerdb.com\/pl\/decklist\/8678\/striving-for-perfection-v2-jinteki-q1-2014-earnings-cast-\">a prosperous trip to U.S. Nationals<\/a>, the company managed to beat expectations and increase its profits quarter-over-quarter thanks to a first place tournament win at Centerville's Epic Loot Games &amp; Comics (Cincinnati\/Dayton meta). 11 competitors participated in the event, and Jinteki faced a variety of opponents, including a StimShop Chaos Theory, a Supplier Kate, a Parasite Andromeda, and a Duggars Whizzard (three wins, one timed win).<\/p>\n\n<p>Chairman Hiro commented, \"While our approach hasn't shifted much in recent months, we have made slight but profitable adjustments to Jinteki's security measures, cutting our operating losses while responding to runners' adapting attack strategies. For example, we have fine-tuned our Intrusion Countermeasures Electronics suite, taking advantage of a bump in influence availability by upgrading a <em>Viper<\/em> to a <em>Caduceus<\/em>. Though it's just a one-off ICE, the serpentine switch allows us to quickly recoup our costs if activated early. It also enables the company to vary its ICE strength, which is crucial in combating AI-dependent hackers.\"<\/p>\n\n<p>\"While Jinteki has received criticism for not following current trends and adopting <em>Enhanced Login Protocols<\/em>, we believe this is the best plan for the company when taking into consideration our strengths and weaknesses, along with the current landscape with our local competitors. We have renewed our licensing agreement with Haas-Bioroid to continue using <em>Ash 2X3ZB9CY<\/em> units for overseeing Jinteki's security operations -- this contract complements our <a href=\"http:\/\/www.netrunnerdb.com\/en\/decklist\/4964\/untrashable-v6\">Untrashable philosophy<\/a> and <em>Encryption Protocol<\/em> assets, unlike an approach relying on <em>Enhanced Login Protocols<\/em>.\"<\/p>\n\n<p>\"Foregoing those protocols also allows us to shore up our defenses in other ways. We have heard our investors' concerns over anarchic runners wreaking havoc with corporation servers as of late, and seek to rid them of those worries. Our <em>Cerebral Static<\/em> technology completely neutralizes any threats those digital terrorists pose, and hampers a number of other hackers too. Furthermore, Jinteki has shored up its defenses by doubling the number of indestructible <em>Lotus Field<\/em> ICE we employ. And re-introducing <em>Snares<\/em>, paired with certain hazardous AI projects, also discourages runners from rampantly accessing our private documents.\"<\/p>\n\n<p>Jinteki is increasing its expected production growth target and profit forecast for the fiscal year. It intends to make several announcements regarding infrastructure security, advancements in <em>Industrial Genomics<\/em>, and improvements with its <em>Turtleback<\/em> line of clones in the coming months.<\/p>\n\n<pre><code>###\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<p><strong>About Jinteki Corporation<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Jinteki Corporation (JNTK) is an innovative biomedical and cloning technologies company, developing products and offering support for thousands of businesses and government agencies.

She only has to go off once or twice to put you in very easy Scorch\/Junebug flatline range.  She also combos well with <a href=\"\/en\/card\/05004\">House of Knives<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>As for the ICE suite,  <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04013\">Himitsu-Bako<\/a> is there to protect centrals, especially HQ in case of siphons.  <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02015\">Snowflake<\/a> is also a solid defense, and can be used as a <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02056\">Pop-up Window<\/a> if required.  Worst case scenario, it still requires 2 creds and a corroder to deal with.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"\/en\/card\/02073\">Bullfrog<\/a> can divert runs over to a remote loaded with Junebug, or just send the runner over to Archives if need be.  It also combos with <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02094\">Whirlpool<\/a>, which should be the outer ice on the protected remote to force runners into Junebug.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"\/en\/card\/06003\">Lotus Field<\/a> is solid binary ice, which really messes up decks that rely on Yogs and Datasuckers\/Parasites.  Too effective not to include.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"\/en\/card\/05017\">Komainu<\/a> forces decks to go searching for a sentry breaker.  It's vulnerable to mimic but will still cost 5 to avoid taking any net damage.  Even if the runner only decides to take 1 damage, that leaves an opening for <a href=\"\/en\/card\/05022\">Tori Hanz\u014d<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"\/en\/card\/05018\">Pup<\/a> is decent, low cost, taxing ice.  Not much to be said about it.  <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04074\">Tsurugi<\/a> forces stealth decks to spend stealth credits on Daggers.

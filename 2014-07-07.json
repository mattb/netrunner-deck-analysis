Most of the time.\nAnarch... well top players say siphon is a disguised anarch card... and I am not saying they are wrong. Siphon is an excellent card in anarch and everyone excpets it with good reason. \nHowever, starting the creation of every runner deck by adding 3 siphons is rather boring, so I created this deck.<\/p>\n\n<p>Let's talk about the way I spend influence first:<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"\/en\/card\/02024\">e3 Feedback Implants<\/a> are by far the best breaker for bioroids. They don't cost MU and break every bioroid for 1-2 clicks and very little credits.\nEli for a click and a credit is far easier to stomach than Eli for 2 clicks or 4 credits. It is also an enabler for <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04043\">Knight<\/a> and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02102\">Darwin<\/a> letting them break Ice they usually don't (which doesn't mean you should go around and try to break them casually).<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"\/en\/card\/03038\">Clone Chip<\/a>: I know... one ofs are bad for consistency. Thing is, clone chip is nice to have in this deck, but not necessary. It can serve a variety of roles... It protects against weyland hardware destruction shennanigans reasonably and you can always threaten a surprise breaker out of the archive with it.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"\/en\/card\/03046\">Self-modifying Code<\/a>: Tutoring... I think in the current environment nothing is as important as a runner as finding solutions and angles of attack quickly and self modifying code does just that.<\/p>\n\n<p>Let's talk about breakers next:\n<a href=\"\/en\/card\/01007\">Corroder<\/a> and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01011\">Mimic<\/a> are there because wraparound and jinteki are a thing.\nMimic will quickly let you run most jinteki servers without fear or any support.\n<a href=\"\/en\/card\/02102\">Darwin<\/a> can quickly threaten gear check ice and often will at one point or another induce a virus wipe (especially if you hide some your other breakers...).\n<a href=\"\/en\/card\/05053\">Overmind<\/a> is your expensive get out of jail card... Mimic and Overmind mean, you cannot be locked out and you can be aggressive early on.\n<a href=\"\/en\/card\/04043\">Knight<\/a>: I do think Knight needs no explanation ;-) Best barrier breaker in the game and does break other stuff on top of it.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"\/en\/card\/01012\">Parasite<\/a> is our last breaker... 3 times without recursion you get to kill nasty (i.e. needlessly expensive... I am looking at you komainu) ICE.<\/p>\n\n<p>Angles of Attack:\nWe have several angles in this deck:\n<a href=\"\/en\/card\/02063\">Scrubber<\/a>: 2 Scrubbers is like having whizzards ID ability and even one is not that bad. With asset economy being a thing and Jackson Howard being in most decks, these are almost never a bad thing to have.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"\/en\/card\/04082\">Hemorrhage<\/a>: The beauty of it is not its ability, the beauty is, that any run will load it up. It is a true multi vector threat, especially with scrubber it means you can go and clear those remotes and even get some milling out of it.\n<a href=\"\/en\/card\/04061\">Keyhole<\/a> is our R&amp;D threat of choice. I chose this over <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01010\">Medium<\/a> because of two reasons: Low agenda density dekcs are becoming more and more common so trying to win of R&amp;D is getting more difficult and keyhole is better at sniping nasty stuff.\n<a href=\"\/en\/card\/02041\">Nerve Agent<\/a> is in there because it combos nicely with <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04082\">Hemorrhage<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>As for economy... I am not totally happy with it yet. <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02091\">Kati Jones<\/a> is of course a beast and is what keeps us afloat in the mid to late game but the beginning is sometimes slow, especially if you don't draw into your parasites quickly enough to enable early runs. That is usually solved by <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01009\">Djinn<\/a>.\n<a href=\"\/en\/card\/04009\">John Masanori<\/a> is there to give us some draw.<\/p>\n\n<p>So... how do you play this?\nWell... it depends ;-) Basically you threaten on multiple servers and exploit where the corp is weakest, trying to accumulate more money than the corp and preventing scoring windows to appear. Don't try, just because a keyhole is on the table to force your way into R&amp;D, if R&amp;D is becoming expensive, djinn that nerve agent or a <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04082\">Hemorrhage<\/a> and go wreak havoc somewhere else.\nAs for a starting hand... We are looking for <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01012\">Parasite<\/a> or <a href=\"\/en\/card\/05053\">Overmind<\/a> some economy and an angle of attack. Which one is not hugely important, though some are of course better than others depending on your matchup. <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02041\">Nerve Agent<\/a> is usually the weakest, because everyone defends HQ anyway ;-)\nOften <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02063\">Scrubber<\/a> is pretty decent against FA or glaciers as especially in the beginning they usually defend their assets over the trash costs.\nAgainst other corps keyhole is usually the best bet.<\/p>\n\n<p>So... thanks for reading this huge wall of text and I appreciates all feedback :-)<\/p>\n","username":"Dominik","cards":{"01002":2,"01007":1,"01009":2,"01011":1,"01012":3,"01050":3,"01053":2,"02009":2,"02024":2,"02041":1,"02063":2,"02091":3,"02102":2,"03038":1,"03046":3,"04009":2,"04041":1,"04042":3,"04043":3,"04061":2,"04082":2,"05053":3}},{"id":7427,"name":"Unhealthy Obsessions","creation":"2014-07-07 05:01:16","description":"<p>One of six decks I've built for my first Netrunner evening tonight.<\/p>\n\n<p>Lots of viral things going on: Parasite, DataSucker and Surge being used to break down ice.

Same old thing has the same problem, 3 clicks is only worth it if you're siphoning and that is a huge investment in influence if you're going to be consistent with it (which planned attack doesn't help enough with). Indexing is a great card but it can get click intensive, especially if you use it with same old thing. <\/p>\n\n<p>So, enter the program variant of CT, keyhole to replace indexing, Sneakdoor to replace legwork, parasite recursion to deal with low str ice and faerie recursion to blow through sentries cheap. Mimic is there to be an SMC option for breaking sentries on the fly if the Faerie may not be appropriate. Test Run\/Scavenge is still there for the Femme.  Very important to have good sentry options in any situation.  1x Deus X to deal with those pesky Jinteki trap decks so I can check remotes with impunity.<\/p>\n\n<p>Early doors MO is everything and this can lead to MU problems, MU is the key problem with this deck currently I feel. That being said, it's important to clarify that you'll only be bringing out the relevant program each game, you're never going to have Sneakdoor and keyhole out at the same time for instance. If a program does have to leave to board, clone chips and scavenge can bring back key threats or breakers when they are needed again. \nDino is there to hopefully alleviate the mem problem as well as boost up a breaker of my choice to deal with key taxing ice threats (eli, inazuma etc). Escher is there to also cause problems to taxing decks and add some much needed HQ pressure. At the right time it can be absolutely devastating. Because I really don't want to see Dino in duplicates or even at all in some games, I've gone for 2x Dino and 2x Mem Chip.  Being able to hit 6 memory by the midgame is quite important for this deck and they have the added bonus of doubling up as power shutdown defence.<\/p>\n\n<p>Finally, modded works well with the style of deck as most programs about half of my hardware is cost 3 or higher.

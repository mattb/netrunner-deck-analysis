(Why not Chaos Theory? Well, 2 reasons I went with Kate: her ability and link. Most of the FA decks in my meta, and seeming a lot of metas right now, are NBN and having even 1 link can be a HUGE help. And her ability makes all these installs a little cheaper, which is fantastic. The MU from CT would be nice, but Kate can make due.)<\/p>\n\n<p>The general idea is to burst draw through your deck, looking for the super cheap version of breakers (Mimic, Corroder, Zu. 13) and getting them installed on the cheap with Kate's ability. As you continue, you want to find ways to \"cheat\" (Retrieval Run) the bigger, better versions of the breakers out (Garrote &amp; Torch namely) and have maximum efficiency when running. The Akamatsu's are there for super cheap memory to accommodate all the MU that the bigger programs will take up. <\/p>\n\n<p>Save the Test Runs, SMC's and Clone Chips for things you NEED (Sharpshooter, Deus Ex, Nerve Agent) depending on the situation. Best case scenario, you burst draw into all the programs you need, trashing the rest and grabbing them out if needed. <\/p>\n\n<p>Your main money is Armitage and FCC. The idea here is that it is super fast money on demand, which is exactly what you need against FA Corps. MagOps needs too much MU to stay in the rig for long, plus it's upfront cost can really kill your tempo. Recycle Sure Gamble, Armitage and FCC with Levy's and keep the money train running. <\/p>\n\n<p>Things I'd like to have: I'd LOVE to have Desperado in this deck, but the influence really needs to go programs. I thought about using a Battering Ram, but that would have just been nuts MU wise! I'd also like to use Medium, but I already have an in-faction answer for that, so that will do. I'd also like to put something like Dirty Laundry for more burst econ, but this deck has to stay at 45 cards.<\/p>\n","username":"omegalife2002","cards":{"01007":2,"01011":1,"01026":1,"01033":1,"01034":3,"01038":3,"01050":3,"01053":3,"02007":1,"02009":2,"02041":1,"02047":2,"02066":1,"02087":3,"02101":2,"02107":2,"03033":3,"03035":3,"03038":3,"03040":1,"03046":2,"04047":1,"04065":1,"04067":1}},{"id":1698,"name":"Katman strikes","creation":"2014-01-24 14:35:38","description":"\n","username":"Shimmer","cards":{"01007":1,"01008":3,"01011":1,"01012":1,"01033":1,"01034":3,"01038":3,"01050":3,"01053":3,"02003":1,"02007":1,"02009":2,"02041":2,"02087":2,"02091":3,"02106":3,"02107":3,"03035":2,"03038":3,"03040":3,"03046":3,"03052":3}},{"id":1699,"name":"Wide Jinteki","creation":"2014-01-24 16:09:40","description":"<p>A bad deck due to having limited data packs.<\/p>\n","username":"cbob","cards":{"01057":2,"01062":1,"01067":1,"01068":3,"01069":1,"01070":3,"01071":1,"01072":2,"01075":1,"01076":3,"01077":3,"01078":2,"01090":1,"01098":3,"01100":2,"01101":1,"01106":1,"01108":1,"01110":1,"02032":3,"02033":3,"02039":1,"02060":2,"04053":2,"04054":3,"04059":3}},{"id":1700,"name":"Anarch","creation":"2014-01-24 16:10:40","description":"<p>Bad deck due to limited data packs, and no idea what I'm doing.<\/p>\n","username":"cbob","cards":{"01002":2,"01003":1,"01004":1,"01005":3,"01007":2,"01008":3,"01009":2,"01011":2,"01012":3,"01014":2,"01015":1,"01016":1,"01019":2,"01022":2,"01026":1,"01034":2,"01041":1,"01047":1,"01049":3,"01050":2,"01053":2,"02022":3,"04041":1,"04043":3}},{"id":1701,"name":"Nothing But Net","creation":"2014-01-24 16:52:45","description":"<p>Fast advance little ice, generate income with Profiteering and operations, score seven points or let the runner die trying to do the same.<\/p>\n","username":"Ducttape2021","cards":{"01067":1,"01068":1,"01069":3,"01070":3,"01072":3,"01073":3,"01100":3,"01110":3,"02032":3,"02033":3,"02080":3,"02112":2,"03009":3,"03023":3,"04032":3,"04039":3,"04040":1,"04073":3,"04076":3}},{"id":1702,"name":"Jinteki megt grinder Beta 0.1","creation":"2014-01-24 17:37:03","description":"<p>This is a hypothesis deck that seeks to make only 1 remote.

Also, don't forget you can pump a breaker outside of an encounter as well, and with the programs I've included, the pumped strength will actually stick until you need it<\/li>\n<li>I feel Snitch is super-important because it tells you whether you can get in on a late-game run without risking getting shut down by a rez<\/li>\n<li>Being able to break Archer for  4 credits or less is super-important, hence Sharpshooter<\/li>\n<li>Kati - just load her up all game long, banking credits for the one turn you're really gonna needed and no unrezzed ice is in your way (that turn will most definitely come, I have no doubt)<\/li>\n<li>Liberated Accounts - I feel these are actually the best economy card available for this guy at the moment: if you have 6 credits and want to run on unrezzed ICE, bank'em!

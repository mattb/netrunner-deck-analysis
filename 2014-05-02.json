This deck is designed to exploit the 5 click advantage that <strong>GRNDL Power Unleashed<\/strong> starts with to outrace the Runner's use of Bad Publicity credits.  Phase 1 should be constructing defenses for HQ and R&amp;D, with a possible early <strong>Project Junebug<\/strong> flatline if the Runner is showing high aggression.  Phase 2 should focus on constructing solid defenses alongside Agenda scoring to delay Phase 3 as long as possible.

They're not wrong, but what it does for the deck is pretty significant. Rainbow is great for shaking breakers out and onto the table, which in turn activates your Ichis. Nothing is worse than the runner just walking through an Ichi for 1 click or a couple bucks, so using rainbow to get a breaker into play not only gets your program trashing online, but also has the runner getting programs tabled quicker than they might not normally. Any tempo you can get the runner to give up in the first couple turns is going to be clutch.<\/p>\n\n<p>Director Haas is there to basically force a run, or if the runner doesn't take the bait, to quickly and efficiently begin to chain out agendas. If you've got the pieces for a kill, you can stick the runner into a catch-22 with a naked Director Haas in a remote. <\/p>\n\n<p>The single Precog is a bit of a black sheep, but if you end up getting it early, especially with your heavy recursion, it gives you tremendous power over pace of the early game, and mid-late game keeps you from spinning your wheels trying to find that second combo piece (biotic or SEA Source or whatever).<\/p>\n","username":"falseidol","cards":{"01058":3,"01059":3,"01062":2,"01073":1,"01086":2,"01099":2,"01106":3,"01110":3,"03001":1,"03005":3,"03010":1,"03015":2,"03017":2,"03019":2,"04040":3,"04090":3,"04100":2,"04110":3,"04111":3,"04119":3,"05025":3}},{"id":4908,"name":"THE DANGER ZONE","creation":"2014-05-02 14:45:03","description":"<p>\u201cI won\u2019t lie to you.

Trash jackson as early as possible by either making a run on him, or making a run on archives with an agenda in it, forcing them to remove him. Remote pressure is done by Inside Jobs, Crypsis, Femme, and Quest Completed.<\/p>\n","username":"steevo15","cards":{"01021":3,"01022":3,"01026":1,"01030":2,"01050":3,"01051":1,"02025":2,"02028":3,"02069":3,"02091":2,"02105":2,"03055":1,"04004":3,"04061":2,"04081":1,"04106":3,"05028":1,"05031":2,"05037":2,"05041":2,"05042":2,"05046":2}},{"id":4919,"name":"Adventures In Icebreaking","creation":"2014-05-02 17:11:09","description":"<p>It's not a complicated deck.

Overall I like Liberated Account more, but the most common tag punishment I've been seeing is Closed Accounts, and it is sometimes risky to save up for Liberated. With Codebusting even after going into tag-me mode while the Corp is holding Closed Accounts, you can still install, click twice, and do what you need to do. Another minor benefit of Codebusting I did not consider before is that you can play out multiples easier, freeing some space in the hand when needed.<\/p>\n\n<p>-2 Vamp, +2 Imp: Vamp was the card that originally inspired this deck, and even I am surprised that I'm removing them. I desperately want to like Vamp, but in the two games I actually managed to play it, I didn't feel that it added much except slowing the game down (I won one and lost the other). The main idea was to slow down NBN FA, and I hope Imp can also do that by trashing SanSan. Another advantage of Imp is that it plays nicely with Deja Vu &amp; Grimoire, although I'm not sure if that'll make much of a difference.<\/p>\n","username":"datadouble","cards":{"01002":2,"01006":2,"01007":3,"01008":3,"01010":2,"01011":3,"01012":3,"01014":3,"01018":3,"01022":1,"01050":3,"01053":3,"02003":2,"02009":2,"02041":2,"02065":1,"02091":2,"03052":3,"04041":1,"04043":2}},{"id":4922,"name":"Every Wall Is a Gate.","creation":"2014-05-02 17:58:06","description":"<p>Give Yog steroids with Dinossaurs, Personal Touch and Datasucker.

The deck uses grappling hook + E3 as its backup breaker.  I think they work well together because most of the big ice that's super pricey to break with Overmind have multiple subroutines, and can be easily grappled.  SMC, Scavenge, and clone chips are there for all the standard Shaper search and recursion shenanigans.  Deus X and parasite are in there to be summoned up when needed, and ignored otherwise.  I'm debating finding space for an Inti to deal with wraparound (grappling hooks already takes care of swordsman).   <\/p>\n\n<p>The deck does not run a lot of extra memory just a single deep red as it's too big a boost to pass up.  Other than Overmind all your other programs discard after use so you will almost always be installing Overmind with 4 counters, If you need to stretch out an Overmind you can use E3 to make it last longer.  There is plenty of program recursion in the deck as well as a Levy\/Same Old Thing so you should certainly be able to get enough tokens to last through the game.  I guess I just don't feel like devoting the deck space\/clicks\/credits that it would take to get a massive pile of tokens on an Overmind.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Anyways feel free to give it a test and tell me what you think.  I will hopefully get a chance to get in a few games with it this weekend to get a better idea of how viable it is.<\/p>\n","username":"Suzume Kazo","cards":{"01012":1,"01034":3,"01050":3,"01053":3,"02009":2,"02024":3,"02046":1,"02066":1,"02091":1,"02107":2,"03034":3,"03035":1,"03038":3,"03046":3,"03053":3,"03054":1,"04042":1,"05045":3,"05053":3}},{"id":4926,"name":"TI slow advance v. 1.0","creation":"2014-05-02 18:48:47","description":"\n","username":"bzykuu","cards":{"01062":1,"01068":3,"01069":2,"01090":1,"01103":2,"01110":3,"02013":2,"02070":2,"03015":1,"04012":3,"04013":2,"04053":3,"04073":3,"04074":2,"04093":1,"04100":1,"04114":3,"04119":1,"04120":2,"05003":1,"05007":3,"05015":3,"05016":3,"05018":1,"05020":1}},{"id":4927,"name":"Gabe Knight 2.0","creation":"2014-05-02 19:23:29","description":"<p>Based on Ser Gabriel by CrimsonWraith (http:\/\/netrunnerdb.com\/en\/decklist\/2511\/ser-gabriel), also seen on Team Covenant as Gabe Knight (https:\/\/teamcovenant.com\/blog\/2014\/04\/09\/v-netrunner-store-championship-2014-tulsa-ok\/).<\/p>\n\n<p>Changes from the original version:<\/p>\n\n<p>+3 Planned Assault: The only card from H&amp;P that I really wanted to try. 2 might be sufficient, but starting with 3 just in case.<\/p>\n\n<p>-1 Inside Job: 2 copies are sufficient w\/Planned Assault.<\/p>\n\n<p>-1 Blackmail (only in the TC version): This rarely works for me, I didn't want to keep it even after adding Planned Assault.<\/p>\n\n<p>-1 Plascrete: I needed one more slot, but I might go back to three after testing Planned Assault.<\/p>\n","username":"datadouble","cards":{"01007":2,"01011":1,"01014":1,"01017":1,"01018":3,"01021":2,"01022":3,"01024":3,"01026":1,"01028":3,"01050":3,"01053":3,"02009":2,"02043":3,"02104":2,"02106":1,"03052":3,"03054":3,"04043":3,"05036":3}},{"id":4928,"name":"Caprice Imaging","creation":"2014-05-02 20:03:18","description":"<p>After being beaten by my brother's Kit Gordian Paintbrush with Planned Assault Vamp Siphon (Kati Jones Magnum Opus Econ), I think Caprice would keep CI's HQ stronger.<\/p>\n","username":"ellonellanfair","cards":{"01058":3,"01059":3,"01061":2,"01062":2,"01064":2,"01106":3,"01110":3,"02051":3,"02110":3,"03001":1,"03005":3,"03019":3,"04034":3,"04040":3,"04090":3,"04096":1,"04100":2,"04111":2,"04114":2,"05014":3}},{"id":4929,"name":"GRNDL: Agendacation","creation":"2014-05-02 20:47:17","description":"<p>Modified Quick as a Corpse deck with more ice and less econ.<\/p>\n\n<p>Deleting by tomorrow don't bother judging me.<\/p>\n","username":"therizzlesign","cards":{"01069":2,"01094":3,"01101":3,"01102":3,"02060":3,"02120":3,"04015":2,"04017":3,"04020":3,"04039":3,"04040":3,"04057":2,"04078":3,"04097":1,"04098":3,"05015":3,"05023":3}},{"id":4932,"name":"Medtech Fast Advance","creation":"2014-05-02 21:17:08","description":"\n","username":"TheHydrogenator","cards":{"01070":3,"01078":1,"01092":2,"01110":3,"02014":3,"02060":1,"03019":1,"03023":1,"04012":3,"04013":2,"04015":2,"04032":3,"04033":1,"04074":2,"04114":2,"05001":1,"05005":3,"05006":1,"05010":2,"05011":3,"05016":2,"05018":3}},{"id":4934,"name":"Nisei Rush","creation":"2014-05-02 22:27:23","description":"\n","username":"Anima","cards":{"01062":2,"01110":3,"02015":3,"02056":2,"02059":2,"03014":3,"04015":2,"04020":2,"04032":3,"04058":1,"04073":3,"04114":3,"04117":1,"04120":3,"05002":1,"05005":3,"05006":1,"05007":3,"05009":3,"05016":2,"05017":2,"05024":2}},{"id":4935,"name":"Silhouette","creation":"2014-05-02 22:48:53","description":"<p>Just a deck I've finished now that H&amp;P is out.

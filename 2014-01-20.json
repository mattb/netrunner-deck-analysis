There are few resources to trash if tagged and hopefully a Wyldside to keep you in cards (therefore health), so you can run by the seat of your pants.<\/p>\n\n<p>Be aggressively Criminal, running to make money with Desperado and trashing as much as you can with Imp and Keyhole while building counters on Medium and Nerve Agent. Disrupt the corp's cashflow and make them rez expensive ice while you collect Datasucker tokens. Keep your sights on the Central servers. Kill big ice with a hot infusion of Parasite and Datasucker. If the corp kills your tokens, it's still a small victory-- they busted a whole turn to do it.<\/p>\n\n<p>Can't run? Install lots of viruses. Scheherazade can hold 'em all and will pay you for the privilege. Each will mill R&amp;D while they're at it.

It looks to leave openings, then punish the runner for taking them. <\/p>\n\n<p>The key to this deck is the 1x2 3x6 agenda composition - the strongest late-game against random accesses, according to this article.\nhttp:\/\/boardgamegeek.com\/blogpost\/16294\/agenda-compositions\nThe cheap ICE helps the deck get there.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Other strengths of the agenda spread: \n    * Punitive Counterstrike will almost always hit for 3, at least. \n    * less Agendas = more space for other cards. \n    * zero bad reputation.  <\/p>\n\n<p>The reason you don't want to run 21 points (1x3 3x6) is how much weaker it is to random accesses (again, see link above).  Remember, the goal of this deck is to let the runner succeed on runs and punish him, not to push agendas.  <\/p>\n\n<p>However, the Agenda comp does have its weaknesses: \n    * less burst economy = less credit for traces = no SEA Source. \n    * no Project Atlas.  See note about Jackson Howard below. \n    * very difficult to run Archer.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Why run... \nGrim?  It's a substitute for Archer.  Its lack of ETR is manageable because at some point, you want to let the runner through. \nOnly 1 Data Raven?  It's a card you actually don't want out too often because it discourages running.  Late game, it's the ICE you want to advance Agendas behind. \nGreen Level Clearance?  This deck doesn't have the economy to play Restructure consistently.  I'm considering switching it out for Pad Campaign for a more Never-Advance style and using the Influence for an extra Data Raven. \nOff The Grid?  For when the player is being too cautious.  Also couples well with DRT.  <\/p>\n\n<p>How To Play:<\/p>\n\n<p>Use the cheap ICE to advance and score a 3\/5 Agenda ASAP, then focusing on baiting the runner into tags for DRT and Scorched.  <\/p>\n\n<p>The deck plays slightly differently if the first Agenda you score is Government Contract.  Use the economy you gain to install every piece of ICE you draw, set up DRT in a remote, then drop Off The Grid.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Notes: \n    * Punitive Counterstrike is more a setback than a win condition.  Use it to disrupt the runner's tempo after a successful run. \n    * Remember to rez DRT in response to any tags. \n    * Jackson Howard is very good in this deck.  You are as unlikely to draw Agendas as the runner is because of the light Agenda spread, so feel free to draw past your hand size to dig for what you need.  Recycle Agendas first, then Snares!<\/p>\n","username":"sladextekno","cards":{"01070":3,"01087":2,"01088":1,"01093":1,"01098":3,"01099":3,"01103":3,"01110":3,"01111":3,"01113":3,"02019":2,"02070":2,"02077":3,"02080":2,"02118":3,"04015":3,"04020":3,"04036":3,"04038":2,"04079":2}},{"id":1586,"name":"HB FA","creation":"2014-01-20 13:00:03","description":"<p>My take on HB FA.

Previously it ran three mediums instead of Keyhole but I wanted to try out the new tech.<\/p>\n\n<p>Anyway, here's how it works: The goal is to build up a ton of money, a crypsis with counters enough to get through to HQ, a keyhole and a vamp in hand. You vamp using your money to make the corp broke and then pop all your all-nighters so that you can run r&amp;d a bunch of time in one turn and bin enough agendas to win. Even if you don't win there, you have a strong rig versus a broke corp. <\/p>\n\n<p>So card choices: Sacrificial Construct is there purely to handle Swordsman. Once people got wise to the deck, this became a problem if they put it on hq in front of anything that ended the run. This solves that problem.<\/p>\n\n<p>Inside job. This exists to keep you in the game early. If you are luck you can nab an agenda against a corp that doesn't expect to need to double layer, if not you force them to rez another piece of ice, and hopefully put you further ahead in the credit race.<\/p>\n\n<p>Keyhole vs Medium: Like I said I'm trying out keyhole but medium might still be better. The keyhole doesn't see as deep and you can just randomly miss even with 6 runs where as this is almost impossible with three mediums. the problem with medium is the jinteki match up. It can be a nightmare, especially now that shock! is in decks. Luckily Snare does nothing against you but just an unlucky series of fetal AI can be problematic.<\/p>\n\n<p>Magnum opus: Should probably be a Armitage codebusting, but i forget what I had originally. <\/p>\n","username":"Luzifer","cards":{"01021":2,"01034":3,"01044":1,"01048":3,"01050":3,"01051":3,"02021":3,"02046":1,"02049":3,"02067":3,"02091":3,"02109":3,"03046":3,"03049":3,"03053":3,"04061":1}},{"id":1597,"name":"Big Mac v0.1","creation":"2014-01-20 18:08:32","description":"<p>Big Rig is back!

Even if they get in to whatever server you have set up they still have to trash the ash\/red herrings you have sitting there. <\/p>\n\n<p>I originally had scorched in the deck but I was never happy with it. To often (read: every game) it sat in my hand and did nothing. Since I didn't want to sink the influence to run two it never became relevant so I cut it. I put in Director Haas as an experiment, because she has been insane for me in every deck I've put her in. <\/p>\n\n<p>City surveillance is a bait card. Its been reasonably good and I always enjoy the game where I play it. Worse case it taxes them a credit and forces them to run a server that drains their econ and then they still have to trash it. Other games its just been a reverse pad campaign so its been fine overall.<\/p>\n\n<p>Chilo primarily works with Viper, forcing the runner to break the first subroutine or at least beat the trace. Sometimes its dumped an extra tag on a draco they face checked. Overall its been nice as a one of, but I could see cutting it if you prefer something else.<\/p>\n\n<p>Aside: ChiLo combines with Bernice and Ash like i think it does correct? even after its been declared successful and their abilities trigger the run is still going on and thus they take the extra tag from chilo.<\/p>\n","username":"Luzifer","cards":{"01080":1,"01081":3,"01082":3,"01084":2,"01088":3,"01091":3,"01109":3,"02013":1,"02016":1,"02020":3,"02036":1,"02052":3,"02055":3,"02056":3,"02097":2,"02110":2,"02115":3,"02117":1,"03010":1,"04014":1,"04015":1,"04031":1,"04055":1,"04076":3,"04077":1}},{"id":1602,"name":"Get that HQ!","creation":"2014-01-20 23:18:48","description":"\n","username":"Monstermontz","cards":{"01007":2,"01011":1,"01017":1,"01018":3,"01021":2,"01022":2,"01024":2,"01026":2,"01028":2,"01049":3,"01050":3,"02007":2,"02009":2,"02043":3,"02085":3,"02086":2,"02091":2,"02104":2,"03049":1,"03054":2,"04004":3,"04048":1}}]

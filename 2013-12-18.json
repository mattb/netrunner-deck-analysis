Therefore, we need to have the necessary cards really fast. They are: Cyber-Cypher, Vamp, Femme\/Tinkering and economy. For this, we have cards like: Diesel, Quality Time, Self-modifying Code and Test Run; the first two to give speed to the deck, and the last two to find whatever we need.\nTo the flatline we have Nerve Agent and Omni-drive (for the MU), and if the game get longer Levy AR.\nEconomy: we have Kiti (we should have it at the first time), and Armitage (over Magnum because of the cost and 2MU), and explosive credits like: Dirty and Sure. This is a part to consider a lot.\nThe deck carries cards for \"the rise of Jinteki\", like: Net Shield and Daus X (also for AP ices); Deus X+Clone Chip will save your ass many times.\nI like this deck, because isn't the normal shaper deck, and with Andromeda everywhere is something people are not expected.

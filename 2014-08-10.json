The deck's been doing pretty well up to now, from a limited sample side.<\/p>\n\n<p>To win, the runner has to hit three out of seven agendas through some of the most taxing ICE in the game. Six of those agendas set them up for a double Counterstrike kill, so the normal tactic against Glacier of maximising early accesses can backfire horribly. If they guess you are playing Counterstrike, they are likely to run less aggressively early on - when you are at your most vulnerable - giving you time to set up.<\/p>\n\n<p>Rez early and often to tax them from the the word go. Try to get Adonis or Eve going behind a cheap ICE. The flatline threat lets you push your first agenda a bit more aggressively than in an ordinary glacier build. If you get Vitruvius go all out to double over advance it since it lets a single Counterstrike do nine damage. Later on you have Ash to score agendas behind and Memories to recur it. You also have Domestic Sleepers to bait runs or close the game out and Archer to open an enormous scoring window if they hit it (even the fear of it, with a Sleepers on the table, can be enough to get an agenda through).<\/p>\n","username":"bayushidavid","cards":{"01054":1,"01056":3,"01058":2,"01061":2,"01062":2,"01090":2,"01101":1,"01106":3,"01110":3,"02013":2,"02051":1,"02092":3,"02110":3,"03006":3,"03015":1,"03019":2,"04011":3,"04015":3,"04040":2,"04079":3,"06001":2,"06002":3}},{"id":8421,"name":"Accelerated Beta Testing","creation":"2014-08-10 08:14:47","description":"<p>This Is my main deck atm it's been built up and changed to what you see now. <\/p>\n\n<p>For the most part is a solid HB fast advance deck with a few things that makes it my own using next ICE has proven to be an improvement with silver out now. <\/p>\n\n<p>The Inazuma's have gone as i run rather slim on ICE and if you start with them their a huge detriment to your play.

It is very much inspired by Ryan Burke's Retired Motivational Speaker (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.netrunnerdb.com\/en\/decklist\/5736\/retired-motivational-speaker-petrie-s-colorado-regional-2nd\">v1<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.netrunnerdb.com\/en\/decklist\/6251\/retired-motivational-speaker-v2\">v2<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>VS Jinteki<\/strong> - Replicating Perfection: Twice in one game, The Source stopped me from scoring an Agenda. Luckily, both times, I was able to Imp it. Crypsis is not a suitable Icebreaker for this matchup, but Femme Fatale and Knight saved the day.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>VS Midseasons NBN<\/strong>: I was floating in money, the Midseasons were mostly harmless. The San San City Grids were easy to trash, as well as all the asset economy. I still had to be on my toes because an Agenda could be scored at any time.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>VS HB (I don't know, some kind of experimental glacier click-denial)<\/strong>: This went very bad for the corp, I was a 6 points at the end of turn 2. The quick win didn't help me understand what the deck was supposed to be about. I saw Ichi 1.0 over R&amp;D (Yeah...) and a Strongbox, but yeah, no intelligence gathered.<\/p>\n\n<hr \/>\n\n<p>This is a resource heavy deck for use with the Oracle May + Motivation combo. It includes 27 resources so that it's possible to gamble with Oracle May by naming Resource. It would only work with resources, because you are digging for Motivation while it is not out.<\/p>\n\n<p>Aesop's Pawnshop works with Armitage Codebusting, Daily Casts, Liberated Accounts, the extra Motivation, The Source (to turn it off) and Imp. Most of this makes for great economy.<\/p>\n\n<p>D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu can return The Source or NACH after they have been trashed, and any other non-resource card that was trashed when gambling with Oracle May.<\/p>\n\n<p>Tallie Perrault stops a few cards and works in tandem with NACH. (But see changes)<\/p>\n\n<p>I believe Keyhole is stronger than Medium because every time you use it, you see 3 new cards, while consecutive runs with Medium only show one new card. I believe this is worth the loss of R&amp;D locking.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Changes<\/strong>: Tallie Perrault was not used. I did not see any Subliminal Messaging, and only one Closed Account, and she was not installed for that one. I will replace her with Same-Old Thing. At one point, both my D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu and 1 Crypsis were trashed, and I had to be very careful with Oracle May gambling. Too careful.<\/p>\n\n<p>The Source work very well with Iain. He can play it, break the corp's bank while they overpay for an Agenda, and activate his ability at the same time. This deck is too aggressive for The Source not to be a detriment. I will replace it with a 3rd Motivation, because it's important to be able to find it relatively quickly with Oracle May, so that I may start drawing non-resource cards.<\/p>\n\n<p>Keep in mind, my next click when Oracle May failed was most often to draw.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Whizzard vs Iain Stirling<\/strong>: Whizzard has +5 influence and access to Anarch programs. He can afford to be more aggressive and fit with my playstyle better. He loses access to Hostage, so has to include multiples of connections, notably Oracle May. (So, +3 influence, really...) I believe Pawnshop economy is stronger than Underworld Contacts. He also loses access to Criminal events, but I don't want to include too many non-resource cards anyway.<\/p>\n","username":"mabool","cards":{"01002":2,"01006":3,"01026":1,"01047":2,"01051":2,"01053":3,"02001":1,"02003":3,"02022":3,"02041":2,"02091":2,"02109":3,"03053":3,"03055":1,"04008":2,"04043":3,"04061":2,"04083":2,"04106":3,"05054":3}},{"id":8439,"name":"Refined Bioroids","creation":"2014-08-10 19:33:49","description":"<p>Looking for feedback on my ST deck.<\/p>\n\n<p>its slow play huge tax with mushin no shin traps and grndl refinery.<\/p>\n\n<p>I want Heinlein grid so bad.<\/p>\n","username":"CodeMarvelous","cards":{"01057":1,"01062":1,"01063":3,"01064":2,"01106":3,"01110":3,"02010":1,"02013":3,"02092":3,"02110":3,"03006":3,"03009":3,"03015":1,"03019":2,"04011":3,"04015":3,"04099":3,"04119":1,"05015":3,"06002":3,"06010":2}},{"id":8440,"name":"Tournament: Unnecessary Redundancy","creation":"2014-08-10 19:49:17","description":"\n","username":"bewnt","cards":{"01018":2,"01021":2,"01024":1,"01026":1,"01028":1,"01029":2,"01031":1,"01034":1,"01036":1,"01050":3,"01053":2,"02043":2,"02091":2,"02101":1,"02104":3,"02106":1,"03054":2,"04043":3,"04089":1,"05030":1,"05035":1,"05036":2,"05037":1,"05042":2,"05046":2}},{"id":8441,"name":"Fast sleepers","creation":"2014-08-10 20:33:32","description":"<p>Wall up HQ and R&amp;D and fast advance everything out of hand.<\/p>\n","username":"Whizkid","cards":{"01055":1,"01058":3,"01059":3,"01061":2,"01062":2,"01101":1,"01106":2,"01110":3,"02051":3,"02110":3,"03001":1,"03005":3,"04011":3,"04012":2,"04034":3,"04040":3,"04090":3,"04111":2,"04117":2,"06001":2,"06002":3}},{"id":8442,"name":"pushing the edge","creation":"2014-08-10 21:43:19","description":"<p>I wanted to push the edge and try something different from what is normal plus i like advancement  ice.<\/p>\n","username":"jollyskulls","cards":{"01088":2,"01094":3,"01098":3,"01099":2,"01100":3,"01101":3,"01102":2,"01103":3,"01104":3,"02018":3,"02070":3,"02076":1,"02077":2,"02078":2,"02110":3,"03012":3,"04015":2,"04017":3,"04018":2,"04120":2}},{"id":8443,"name":"Tennin's Arcology","creation":"2014-08-10 21:45:18","description":"<p>EDIT: I played 3 games on stream with this deck\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/ToominNetrunner\">Watch them here<\/a><\/p>\n\n<h1><strong>Tennin's Arcology<\/strong><\/h1>\n\n<p><em>An exploration of Tennin Institute's power<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>There have been a few decks around that have looked at some options for using Tennin's power to its full effect. I haven't seen any that abuse <a href=\"\/en\/card\/03011\">Haas Arcology AI<\/a> as a fast advance mechanism yet.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Key Deck Concepts<\/h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Taxing all the way. We want to have as many turns as possible where the runner can't run, which allows us to use our ID ability. The most important taxing cards are <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01090\">Tollbooth<\/a>, <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02110\">Eli 1.0<\/a>, <a href=\"\/en\/card\/05016\">Inazuma<\/a>, <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01078\">Wall of Thorns<\/a>, and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04114\">Caprice Nisei<\/a> (which forces multiple remote runs)<\/li>\n<li>Use your ID ability to place an advancement token on <a href=\"\/en\/card\/03011\">Haas Arcology AI<\/a> (which can be done even when rezzed), then use the token to score agendas from hand. By placing <a href=\"\/en\/card\/03011\">Haas Arcology AI<\/a> in a taxing server instead of an agenda, you gain all of the benefits (scoring next turn), with none of the risk of putting an agenda down.<\/li>\n<li>Trick of light to agendas from other installed cards is a back up plan, but also works just fine in many situations. <\/li>\n<li>This is a Fast Advance (score from hand) deck, but is not a Rush (finish the game quickly) deck.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<h2>Playstyle<\/h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Try to ice up both HQ and R&amp;D with ice like <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02110\">Eli 1.0<\/a>, <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04093\">Yagura<\/a>, <a href=\"\/en\/card\/05018\">Pup<\/a>, <a href=\"\/en\/card\/05025\">Rainbow<\/a> and create 1 taxing remote which you will be using to put <a href=\"\/en\/card\/03011\">Haas Arcology AI<\/a>, <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04114\">Caprice Nisei<\/a>, or agendas into (if you identify an appropriate timing window). Your remote will ideally have 2 or 3 pieces of ice and will cost a lot to get through. Archives can be lightly protected (maybe 1 piece of ice), with a <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04073\">Shock!<\/a> dumped in there asap.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"\/en\/card\/03023\">Gila Hands Arcology<\/a> is important for your economy, so scoring one early is important.<\/li>\n<li>During the early stages of the game, don't be afraid to not rez central ice and allow accesses if it benefits your mid-term aims like getting a <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04012\">Celebrity Gift<\/a> or <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01110\">Hedge Fund<\/a> played the next turn. Exception: if you're agenda flooded in HQ or for special runs like Indexing or Siphon.<\/li>\n<li>If you suspect siphon, just make HQ expensive to get into so that they don't profit from siphons, then use <a href=\"\/en\/card\/03023\">Gila Hands Arcology<\/a> and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04012\">Celebrity Gift<\/a> to recover once the pressure has abated. I don't usually feel it necessary to use <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04114\">Caprice Nisei<\/a> on HQ as it often serves your remote better, but use your judgement and adjust for each game.<\/li>\n<li>Interns is stunning in this deck. The most important cards to use it on are <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04114\">Caprice Nisei<\/a> and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/03011\">Haas Arcology AI<\/a>. <\/li>\n<li>Don't be afraid to manually advance a facedown <a href=\"\/en\/card\/03011\">Haas Arcology AI<\/a> if they're making too many successful central runs. This forces an expensive remote run and either opens up a regular scoring window, or one using a different mechanism once they're poor.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"\/en\/card\/02033\">Trick of Light<\/a> can either be used on its own to score 3 advancement agendas, or in combination with <a href=\"\/en\/card\/03011\">Haas Arcology AI<\/a> to score <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01068\">Nisei MK II<\/a> or the first <a href=\"\/en\/card\/05005\">Medical Breakthrough<\/a>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<h2>Weaknesses<\/h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Decks with very strong economy and efficient breakers. If they can ensure a successful run every turn, it may be tough to tax them to the point that they can't keep running. Aim to place and rez more ice on the servers its needed.<\/li>\n<li>Successful\/cost effective Account Siphon recursion. This is a weakness of most decks. Make HQ expensive to get into and use <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04114\">Caprice Nisei<\/a> if necessary.<\/li>\n<li>Ice destruction. These decks will make it tough to keep your centrals taxing. Use <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04060\">Interns<\/a> (and then <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04015\">Jackson Howard<\/a> to return <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04060\">Interns<\/a> to your deck), to return destroyed ice to play where you need them most.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<h2>Potential Adjustments and Alterations<\/h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"\/en\/card\/01103\">Ice Wall<\/a> is pretty great in <a href=\"\/en\/card\/05003\">Tennin Institute: The Secrets Within<\/a>, but I didn't really have the influence. It'd be nice to be able to do something with the advancement tokens placed on ice , though.<\/li>\n<li>Agenda mix up. I considered <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04119\">NAPD Contract<\/a> and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04053\">Unorthodox Predictions<\/a>, but felt this composition was more beneficial when scored.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<h2>Additional Notes<\/h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>After completing the deck, I discovered that someone had made use of the idea <a href=\"http:\/\/netrunnerdb.com\/en\/decklist\/5888\/tennis-institute-hass-archology\">here<\/a>, so props to Chicken Slayer!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","username":"Toomin","cards":{"01068":2,"01078":2,"01090":1,"01110":3,"02014":3,"02033":3,"02110":3,"03011":2,"03023":3,"04012":3,"04015":2,"04060":3,"04073":2,"04093":2,"04114":3,"05003":1,"05005":3,"05006":1,"05016":2,"05018":2,"05025":2,"06003":2}}]

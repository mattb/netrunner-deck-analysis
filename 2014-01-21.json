The deck is built to have an economic advantage over the runner, primarily through transaction operations and secondarily through drip economy installed on remote servers. Your pile of creds and exposed HQ may tempt a runner to Account Siphon you, and they may leave themselves tagged and exposed to a Scorched Earth. The runner will also be forced to eat up creds and clicks trashing your drip economy, slowing his own hardware and program installs, which you should be picking off with Grid Overload and Power Shutdown (especially Plascrete Carapace). As you trash cards with Power Shutdown, use Jackson Howard to funnel your trashed Snares! and any agendas you're not ready to score or have scored back into R&amp;D, at which time you should be consolidating your Punitive Counterstrikes and Scorched Earths into HQ. Use Interns to recur your drip economy and Cerebral Overwriters. In the meantime, advance a Cerebral Overwriter to see if they access it blindly. Or start advancing one of the synergistic agendas if you are ready to Punitive Counterstrike if the Runner decides to score it. Who knows, you might even be able to score an agenda if they've already been hit by a Cerebral Overwriter and are hesitant to continue running. If you can score an agenda, it'll make your end-game that much easier, as they amplify meat damage or allow you to search for that last card you need. Eventually, as R&amp;D dwindles, it should be thick with agendas and Snare!s, but you should have the pieces in your hand to flatline the runner when (s)he encounters them. This is a very easy deck to drive considering there are hard and fast rules for what you should do with most of the pieces once you draw them. The only subtleties may be managing how many agendas you wish to leave in archives at one time and whether or not you want to try and advance a Cerebral Overwriter or an agenda. NOTE: Some substitutions for Cerebral Overwriter might be SEA Source or Shock!

The original was the first post I did ever and I got some great ideas.  <\/p>\n\n<p>However, I thought long and hard about how I want to do this deck and couldn't help but going the knight route.  So here's my thoughts and I want to hear some ideas from you guys.<\/p>\n\n<p>Knight can put some good pressure especially with e3 saving you credits.  Corp will want to trash ice and knight if he wants to keep it safe.  Special order can grab the next knight and keep pressuring in areas you want.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Of course, trashing 3 ice for all my icebreakers seem like no big deal until I use levy AR to get them back.  Hopefully sacrificial construct will do some favors as well.<\/p>\n\n<p>Data suckers are more for late game when heavier ice strengths come out.  I'm not sure if I should reduce to 1 x datasucker and add another sacrificial construct to keep the knights alive.<\/p>\n\n<p>Obviously the snitch\/blackguard combo will add pressure and maybe kill more of the corp's Econ. I'm hoping the sneak door will stretch defenses out even more, which makes cards like inside job a lot more viable.<\/p>\n\n<p>Also, stretching Hq thin opens up more for account siphons which make the remote servers useless assuming they have no ice rezzed.  Hopefully emergency shutdowns can help with that if you don't want to move the knight off HQ.  On top of that, Silhouettes ID can't be ignored.<\/p>\n\n<p>Economy seems iffy to me since Kati takes a long time to set up and I really want to get blackguard out ASAP but I'll have to try around.  I think I have a good balance of burst\/sustain for Econ.<\/p>\n\n<p>I dunno.

Hit them hard where it hurts (account siphon), and when they're recovering, go for the jugular (R&amp;D lock).  It does give up a bit of early remote pressure by not including crypsis, but the more I played with it the more of a dead card it seemed to be, so I dropped from 2 to 1 to 0 and now I just rely on SMC and card draw to get me where I need to go.<\/p>\n\n<p>I also dropped one account siphon from the mix, replacing it with a range of tutorable answers (I personally love toolbox-type decks, especially with tons of card draw).  Consistency has never been much of an issue.  My games tend to start with one of three situations: datasucker to force a rez on HQ, letting me know what I need to make my account siphon hit, or SMC into account siphon, or Magnum Opus\/SMC into whatever I need.  Mid\/late game, a combination of Magnum Opus and R&amp;D interface and proceed to lock them out of the game.<\/p>\n\n<p>Many opponents don't expect account siphon from Kate; the ones that do typically don't score early agendas and eventually get shut out by magnum opus economy.<\/p>\n\n<p>Weyland is a laughably easy matchup - since I'm planning to go tagme anyway, and I have 3 plascretes and 6 draw cards.  Once I get a rig together, it's just a matter of time since they have no late game fast advance option.<\/p>\n\n<p>NBN falls into one of two categories - Never Advance taxation, which Magnum Opus &amp; Toolbox are pretty good at handling; or Astrobiotics type super-rush, which SMC can often (not always) deal with.  In either case, R&amp;D lock is a great win condition.<\/p>\n\n<p>Jinteki dies to tutorable Deus X, lots of card draw, and recurrable Levy AR.<\/p>\n\n<p>HB glacier is actually the hardest matchup, but again R&amp;D interface + MO economy saves the day (this was actually the main reason i put datasuckers into the mix, to give me a cost-effective way to deal with Ichis late game).<\/p>\n\n<p>Overall, I think this is a very strong deck with no major weaknesses to any of the main archetypes.  I've taken slight variations of it to 3 store championships and a regular tournament, and only lost 3 games out of 19 (didn't win any prizes, but that's more the fault of my crappy corp decks).<\/p>\n","username":"Ragnarook","cards":{"01007":1,"01008":2,"01012":1,"01018":2,"01026":1,"01033":1,"01034":3,"01035":2,"01041":1,"01043":1,"01044":3,"01050":3,"02009":3,"02066":1,"02087":3,"02106":1,"02107":3,"03035":1,"03038":3,"03040":1,"03046":3,"03054":3,"04067":1,"04086":2}},{"id":3142,"name":"Slow Kate","creation":"2014-03-15 06:13:33","description":"\n","username":"Link","cards":{"01007":1,"01026":2,"01033":1,"01035":3,"01039":3,"01041":2,"01045":1,"01050":3,"01052":2,"02041":1,"02047":3,"02069":3,"02091":2,"02107":3,"03046":2,"03049":3,"04004":3,"04008":3,"04027":3,"04047":1,"04065":1}},{"id":3143,"name":"Noise test","creation":"2014-03-15 07:33:57","description":"\n","username":"Magnetic","cards":{"01001":1,"01002":3,"01006":3,"01007":2,"01008":3,"01009":3,"01011":3,"01012":3,"01014":2,"01018":1,"01044":1,"01050":3,"01053":3,"02003":3,"02009":2,"02043":3,"02087":3,"03052":3,"04061":1}},{"id":3144,"name":"NBN-AggroSec","creation":"2014-03-15 09:48:45","description":"\n","username":"AcidBurn","cards":{"01057":1,"01064":1,"01080":1,"01081":3,"01082":3,"01084":2,"01090":1,"01092":3,"01098":3,"01103":2,"01110":3,"01111":2,"02019":3,"02020":2,"02056":3,"02070":1,"02097":2,"02115":3,"03023":1,"04014":2,"04015":3,"04076":2,"04077":1,"04096":2}},{"id":3146,"name":"Ser Gabriel the Blackguard vHJ 1.0","creation":"2014-03-15 13:18:02","description":"<p>This is my attempt to make a Gabriel blackboard deck.

I mean, either slowing the runner down to effectively 1 click per turn or costing him 2-3 credits more each run, that's gotta be worth something, right? The only possible problem is the loss of economic power, but let's face it - I've been playing Jinteki since core, I'm no stranger to starving :P<\/p>\n\n<p>The ICE package should be pretty self-explanatory. In your opening hand you want to see some econ (yes, Eve is fine too) and either an Eli or a Viktor - those are your early ICE. Don't be afraid to drop Akitaro in a position where he can only rez 1 ICE - if they don't trash him right away, you'll be adding a second ICE soon enough... and once you do, he essentially becomes a Beanstalk! If you actually manage to rez 3 with him, go trash him to reinstall someplace else, he's already done his job. <\/p>\n\n<p>Hudson 1.0 is actually a really good ICE in my experience - he has good synergy with both the unfruitful centrals and the upgrade-based remotes, and a 6-str code gate is a bitch to break. The effect is nothing to scoff at, once he's layered in with some other stuff too.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Agendas: pretty straightforward, the game is closed by a combination of SanSan-powered FA and a Priority Requisition scored the hard way. I used to have 2x Gila Hands in here as a plan B, but they tended to clog up the hand too badly, which became even more of a problem with the addition of Blue Level Clearance. I usually don't trigger the ABTs, but if you do decide to do it, the agenda density is low enough and the ICE brutal enough that triggering it might actually become a really good play if you're feeling lucky. <\/p>\n\n<p>Blue Level Clearance is the newest addition - originally those were Adonises, although I'm rather liking the swap: Adonis needs to be defended, and this deck can use the draw power (since your ICE needs to be all layered). <\/p>\n\n<p>In closing: it's funny how giving +1 STR to Viktor 1.0 and Ichi 2.0 turns them into these supercharged beasts for their cost :P<\/p>\n","username":"PeekaySK","cards":{"01055":3,"01061":2,"01062":3,"01063":3,"01079":3,"01092":3,"01106":3,"01108":3,"01110":3,"02010":1,"02051":3,"02070":3,"02092":3,"02110":3,"03015":2,"03017":2,"03019":2,"04051":2,"04090":3}},{"id":3159,"name":"Chaotic Demolition","creation":"2014-03-15 22:28:34","description":"<p>Stable high-economy CT build.

Laramy Fisk was chosen due to his identity ability which lets us dredge through R&amp;D to trash potentially harmful or inconvenient cards, gather further information on upcoming plays, and to acquire lurking agendas. To help accomplish successful runs I tried to run a reliable suite of Icebreaker's to combat any possible contingency of ice that may be encountered and at the same time have a integrated economy that works from successful runs. This is possible from Djinn's Tutoring ability to find both Datasucker and Pheromones which will both help to 1.) Reduce costs of breaking protecting ice 2.) Provide a recurring buffer of money to be used during runs 3.) To have the Corporation waste occasional turns on clearing virus tokens to attempt to check our icebreaker's potential breaking power. I also included a suite of non program economy: Kati Jones, Easy Mark, Daily Casts, Account Siphon and Desperado to help combat any potential lock outs the runner may come across due to Djinn and attached programs being trashed or impeding ice that cannot be overcome in the short term.<\/p>\n\n<p>Potential Issues: Deck appears to have issues with running remote servers from having only 2 copies of Knight and 2 copies of Femme Fatale to stop any large strength ice and code gates. Also suffers from a lack of program recursion so possible runs might become more complicated as icebreakers become trashed. Finally, since all the deck's fighting potential relies on icebreakers it can fail to get through particular pieces of Ice.<\/p>\n\n<p>Comments on improving deck synergy and\/or play-ability is welcomed and appreciated.<\/p>\n","username":"WarDemon1991","cards":{"00002":1,"01007":2,"01008":3,"01009":2,"01018":2,"01019":3,"01020":3,"01024":2,"01026":2,"01028":2,"01030":2,"01050":3,"02085":3,"02086":2,"02091":2,"02105":2,"03053":3,"04043":2,"04044":1,"04049":2,"05041":2}},{"id":6874,"name":"Clickfcuk v2.0","creation":"2014-06-17 01:33:35","description":"<p>Based both on my original Clickfcuk deck and especially a deck by Run Last Click's Eady called Superfriends (here: http:\/\/runlastclick.blogspot.com\/2014\/06\/deckslists-super-friends.html#more), I wanted to try an all asset economy on top my deck which was all about gaining clicks.

An impractical card yes, but we thought it would be fun to try to build a deck around it.<\/p>\n\n<p>The obvious choice is HB to get a nice, big server over HQ and with <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02079\">Oversight AI<\/a> and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/03013\">Bioroid Efficiency Research<\/a> it would be trivial to get some big hitters up quickly, but we thought that a bit played. One of the problems with <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04038\">Off the Grid<\/a> is iceing up HQ heavily is that leaves R&amp;D lock a pretty big problem. So, our thought was to bring it to Jinteki for the internal R&amp;D traps to help lessen that problem.<\/p>\n\n<p>As a side benefit we would also have <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04114\">Caprice Nisei<\/a> in faction such that even if all of the ice was broken, there is still that chance of pulling out an unsucessful HQ run. Add to that the amount of incredibly taxing ice (since this is a slower deck cheap end the runs were not favorable) Jinteki has access to after Honor and Profit, along with the control ice that is <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02073\">Bullfrog<\/a> and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/05020\">Susanoo-No-Mikoto<\/a> and we thought we would have a little bit of synergy going on. With the amount of Psi going on, Nisei division seemed to be an alright choice, though we are always open to Personal Evolution to get that extra bit of killing open. And we were also thinking about how some of Jinteki's ice stacks really well with <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01075\">Chum<\/a> and whatnot, and gave <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02054\">Sunset<\/a> a chance for our positioned mega-server.<\/p>\n\n<p>One of the thought processes that goes on with <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04038\">Off the Grid<\/a> is what's so important that it has to be protected in such a way, and we felt maybe <a href=\"\/en\/card\/05008\">Chairman Hiro<\/a> such that even getting though the big server we planned, the runner wouldn't have the money to trash. Then, recure with <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04060\">Interns<\/a> and\/or <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04015\">Jackson Howard<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>So those are our general thoughts. I know this deck is not great, but I'm interested to see what  people have to say on the subject, just to get some gears turning. It'll never be compeditive, but sure could be fun or at the very least interesting<\/p>\n","username":"Old Jim","cards":{"01070":2,"01074":1,"01075":2,"01077":3,"01079":2,"01090":2,"01106":2,"01108":2,"01109":2,"01110":2,"02015":2,"02032":3,"02034":1,"02054":2,"02094":2,"04015":2,"04038":3,"04114":2,"05002":1,"05007":3,"05008":2,"05016":2,"05017":2,"05018":2,"05020":1}}]

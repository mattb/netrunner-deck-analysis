I don't think it's quite there; it needs a more elegant solution for its money problems as it stands.<\/p>\n\n<p>I chose a NEXT design deck because I don't like traditional rush strategies. I often find that a pure rush deck tends to be so finely tuned that minor disruptions can often lead to major problems. NEXT, by contrast, can be Iced up and ready to roll turn one. It is not uncommon for this deck to end the first turn with one ice on R&amp;D, one on HQ, two on a remote, and an agenda installed. You can then often outright score that agenda whilst the runner is still finding their feet. You should then be able to use this early advantage to stay ahead, particularly if you scored a good ABT or Mandatory Upgrades.<\/p>\n\n<p>BREAKDOWN:<\/p>\n\n<p>ICE:\nIce is the alpha and omega of this deck, so this took a bit of getting right. If I'm trying to score an early agenda, I need the runner to be stopped dead, and I need to be able to do so without crippling my early economy. Thus, all the ice has ETR except Janus, and over 2\/3 of it costs 3 or less. Thus, if I get either of the economy operations, I should be able to rez at least two bits of ice and still score a 3pt agenda next turn, more or less.<\/p>\n\n<p>When NEXT silver comes out, it will replace Wall of Static, no questions asked. The sentry suite needs work, but there are very few that end runs cheaply. Draco is a bit too porous.<\/p>\n\n<p>Wotan, Heimdall and Janus are all potential ABT winners.<\/p>\n\n<p>Agendas:\nABT is a beast in this deck; add another layer to your centrals, start a new remote, whatever. Yes, you will dump an agenda (at least, I usually do) occasionally, but I took JH out of the deck because it didn't happen enough to worry me. Also, this deck can often overscore Vitruvius, so it's not always totally bleak.\nThe Mandatory Upgrades used to be Efficiency Committees, but I kept finding that I wanted to advance cards with the extra clicks. I gave it a shot, and to be honest the MU's were only slightly harder to score than the Committees. If you can score one, then you can score 8 of the remaining 10 agendas out of hand. \nGila Hands Arcology is, as yet, untested, but I'm hoping it will add some much needed economy to this deck<\/p>\n\n<p>OPERATIONS: \nGet money. Beanstalks used to be GLC, but I never really needed the extra card, but I frequently need the extra credit. I tried Sweeps week, but found it a bit intermittent. The only non-operation I think this deck could use is Power Shutdown, but space is so tight.<\/p>\n\n<p>ASSETS and UPGRADES:\nAsh, of course is groovy. I wish I could fit a third one in... this is the only change for which I would consider dropping ICE.\nPCs has been Melange and Adonis in its time; still not settled on which. Melange is better burst, but too easy to trash. Adonis is passive, but can only give me a limited amount a turn.\nDirector Haas is a card that I either discard when I see it because the time isn't right, or use to win the game. The reward is easily worth the risk if you can protect her even vaguely well for a turn or two.<\/p>\n\n<p>HOW I PLAY:\nGet four bits of ice down by the end of the first turn, with some money, and an agenda behind it. Turn two, score the agenda; ABT for preference. If you think your opponent might take more than 2 turns to set up, then think about MU. If you score that early you'll almost certainly win.\nBeyond that, keep an eye on your money, as it will be low. I rarely needed to set up more than one remote server, unless ABT made it seem attractive.<\/p>\n","username":"Jashay","cards":{"01055":3,"01064":2,"01098":3,"01103":3,"01110":3,"01111":1,"01113":2,"02011":3,"02012":1,"02013":2,"02019":3,"02051":3,"02052":2,"02059":3,"02110":2,"03003":1,"03010":1,"03015":1,"03023":2,"04011":3,"04030":1,"04071":2,"04120":3}},{"id":5954,"name":"Make 'em Pay V 1.2","creation":"2014-05-23 14:33:02","description":"<p>The current Jinteki Deck I am playing, undefeated on OCTGN and doing very well in my local tournaments.<\/p>\n\n<p>Stealing my agendas costs a lot, between sticking Fetal AI and NAPD Contract behind costly ICE like Tollbooth and backed up by Caprice, plus they will need to have already run on my central servers, which sit behind ICE like Komainu, Tsurugi, Yagura, Shiro, Neural Katana to make 'em pay with their hands. Himitsu-Bako can protect Assets depending on who I'm facing. To make matters worse, the ambushes make my opponents think twice before running on any of my central servers; I'll even dare my opponents to run with Celebrity Gift. When they finally manage to steal an agenda, Punitive Counterstrike can make it hurt or even flatline them, but most of the time they just can't afford to take my agendas before I can score up for game. This list is a lot of fun, you'll find yourself daring your opponents to take risks they can't afford. I have on more than one occasion had both my copies of The Future Perfect in my archives, along with a few Shocks and Shi.Kyu's, and watched my opponents pay to just try and steal them time and again.<\/p>\n\n<p>A note about ICE: You want a good mix of taxation and punishment without forgetting the ETR ICE. Tollbooth works wonderfully with the theme of the deck, and the Economy is strong enough to support it. RSVP works similarly, as it prevents any of your Agendas from being stolen, but if your opponent does not realize this they may continue the run anyway, potentially hitting ambushes or other nasty ICE. I have also played many games where I stick RSVP in front of Sundew in order to protect my Econ, so it really functions as a \"jack-of-all-trades\" ICE. Komainu, Neural Katana, and Tsurugi all hit 'em where it hurts, while Yagura and Shiro function beautifully when protecting R&amp;D. Pup is an extra two credits for them to pay- it isn't much, but it's consistent, and without that much cost to you. I usually stick the Himitsu-Bako's in front of Remote Servers containing Sundew or early game Agendas, and move them around later if I need to. Tenma Line is a new card I'm trying out, but I have discovered it allows me to counter the odd Escher or move my ICE where I need them late game.<\/p>\n\n<p>About Ambushes: I don't run advance ambushes, because I rarely rely on bluffing to hurt my opponent. I'll keep my Snares in my hand all game just to make it hurt when they run on HQ, or be afraid of how many their may be left in R&amp;D. Shock! and Shi.kyu serve the same purpose, and you'll notice this deck technically runs 11 ambushes and 9 agendas. Multiaccess hurts them more than it hurts me, especially if they are face-checking  any of my nastier ICE.<\/p>\n\n<p>Let me know what you guys think, feedback is always welcome.<\/p>\n","username":"Cancer Ace","cards":{"01070":3,"01077":1,"01090":2,"02031":1,"02032":3,"02059":2,"04012":3,"04013":3,"04054":3,"04072":1,"04073":3,"04074":1,"04077":2,"04079":3,"04093":2,"04100":2,"04114":2,"04119":3,"05007":3,"05011":2,"05012":1,"05017":2,"05018":1,"05019":1}},{"id":5955,"name":"Make 'em Pay (Runner Version) V1.0","creation":"2014-05-23 14:37:16","description":"<p>I tried to take the concept from my current corp deck of never letting my opponents have any money and apply it to a runner deck.

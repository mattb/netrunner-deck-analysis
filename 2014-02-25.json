[{"id":2589,"name":"Big Beefy HB","creation":"2014-02-25 01:05:00","description":"<p>This is my HB deck I've been having a lot of fun with. It's won about 85% of the matches it has been put through. There's no neat combos or anything like that, just solid, powerful ICE and assets that all have some sort of impact. The only real \"trick\" this deck plays is common with Next Design. Bait the runner with Accelerated Beta Test and have them find they wasted their turn and a bunch of economy for an asset. <\/p>\n\n<p>One card I'm expecting people to comment on is Mandatory Upgrades. The card is bonkers if you can score it, even late game and if it's stolen it's only 2 points and saves you 6 advancement.<\/p>\n\n<p>Please give any and all feedback\/ideas, and I'll try to answer and acknowledge all questions and comments.

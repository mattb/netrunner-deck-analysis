It's not something that you should be planning to use, but rather it's something that alleviates the Criminal faction's difficulty to catch up once fallen behind. <\/p>\n\n<p>Why Morning Star? Because it's awesome! The up-front cost might seem scary at first, but once you break Eli twice, you're on par with Corroder, and it only gets better after that. Breaking Hive once means you're only 1 credit behind a Corroder play, any more encounters are pure win. The memory cost is usually the biggest problem, which is why I'm using Zu (for additional synergy with the Link bit of the deck). Also, Datasuckers. <\/p>\n\n<p>If I had two more influence, the card that would go in would be Donut Taganes, to combat Accelerated Shutdown decks and give me an option to go for denial-based play.<\/p>\n","username":"PeekaySK","cards":{"01008":2,"01018":2,"01022":3,"01026":2,"01029":2,"01031":1,"01032":1,"01050":3,"01051":1,"02004":1,"02007":1,"02009":2,"02028":2,"02069":3,"02091":1,"02105":1,"02107":1,"03054":2,"04004":3,"04063":2,"05028":1,"05035":2,"05037":3,"05041":1,"05042":1,"05046":1,"05048":1}},{"id":6258,"name":"ICEing Up","creation":"2014-05-31 03:23:06","description":"<p>WIP.

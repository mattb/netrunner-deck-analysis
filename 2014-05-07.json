This is the deck I'm planning to take to regionals if The Spaces Between comes in time.<\/p>\n\n<p>In the beginning of the game, you want to get money, and score an agenda quickly. Money should be easy, with Medical Research Fundraiser easily getting you to Restructure level, and many of the agendas help with economy. The cheap stopping ICE really make it possible to score even without ^much money, but you need enough to rez ICE on your centrals and have 3 ICE on the remote.<\/p>\n\n<p>In the middle game, it's rather important to get the runner to run into a rototurret or archer, but in case that doesn't work, 3* WoW, Power Shutdown, and Corporate Troubleshooter, can take up the slack and get rid of troublesome things like corroder, SMC, and Clone Chip. Interns is there to bring all of them back.<\/p>\n\n<p>Once you're at match point, things can either be easy or hard. If you managed to get rid of their breakers in the middle game, you can comfortably score the last agenda. If they still have a sharpshooter, a clone chip, SMC, or Femme Fatale on a Personal Workshop (that last one stopped me from winning the Chronos Protocol I just attended), you need two Corporate Troubleshooters to boost two different things, and you need a lot of money, and you hope that you scored Government Contracts. During this time your remote is the most important thing to work on, and bad publicity is pretty much just a single credit for the runner. Medical Research Fundraiser is worse now, but it's still as good as an easy mark. The troubleshooter is the most important card now, and you want as many as you can get. You'll be rather far through your deck now, but it should be fine. This also the time for mindgames - trying to get them to waste their money on a will-o-wisp or sneaking through a project atlas while they aren't looking.<\/p>\n\n<p>Some notes on cards I used:\n-Corporate Troubleshooter is the core of this deck, and you really cannot have them trashed. If you have them in HQ, ice it up well.\n-Inazuma almost has a \"trash a program\" subroutine. Corporate Troubleshooting it gets around sharp-shooter, one the greatest weaknesses of this deck. If you absolutely need to make a server taxing despite all the BP that is flying around, you can set up a server with this in front of archer.\n-Medical Research Fundraiser is really useful to stop Restructures from becoming dead cards, but despite that, they could be replaced with Beanstalks, which give more net money, which is important for troubleshooting those who use ninja or garotte.\n-The main weakness of this deck before The Spaces Between comes out is that there's not enough volume of program-trashing, and although WoW will pretty much always get trashed the first time, its effect is almost as good as a trash, and still rather good against expensive icebreakers.<\/p>\n\n<p>Cards I don't have:\n-No scorched earth means that people theoretically could go tag-me against me, but most of the time people put up Plascrete against Weyland all the time and some of the cards best against this deck are resources, (Personal Workshop, Xanadu, Same Old Thing for recursion) If I really wanted to add tag punishment, I would probably add in Closed Accounts, which combos with MRF and pretty much means I can score one agenda while they're collecting resources.<\/p>\n\n<p>-I really would like to have Reclamation Order, because it's recursion that works on whatever I have used most of, which tends to be what I also need the most (if I'm going full Power Shutdown, I need to trash every last thing, if I'm trying to score agendas, corporate troubleshooter is good, and if I have a set-up server and just need money, I have 3* Restructure) However, I really need lots of the influence. The only card I could imagine swapping out for it would be MRF, which only acts as economy and could be swapped for Beanstalks.<\/p>\n\n<p>I hope you find this useful, or show me a way to make my deck even better.

First, I thought the name was amusing, and I really wanted to try and make something of the resource-based criminals. The second motivation was wanting to try and make bad publicity work for the runner, since most corps don't have ways to get rid of it.<\/p>\n\n<p>The game plan is generally to set up the Decoy-Activist Support-Aesop's combo to get some bad pub going the corps way, and simply blackmailing the remotes (thanks to user Maugman for this notion), whilst running relatively efficiently against centrals once I get the central breakers out.<\/p>\n\n<p>One copy of Raymond Flint, Data Dealer, and Tallie Perrault to be hostaged out as the matchup requires.<\/p>\n\n<p>I am still unsure whether to run extra copies of the central breakers, or keep three special orders. The former gives some added protection against program trashing due to damage or ice, but the latter offers clearly superior setup ability. While I can search for cards with Logos, I'm not sure if that's enough (and further, don't much like that I can't guarantee having Logos out early).<\/p>\n\n<p>I also worry that as a whole the deck can't provide enough pressure to really slow down a proper fast advance, since the source and chakana both cost influence that Iain doesn't have, and I don't see this deck as offering very strong early aggression to stop things like the Astro-train from getting going.<\/p>\n\n<p>I also feel like I'd like to find room for some Crash Space and (Maybe) Leverage. Crash Space would work like a less impressive Plascrete, while still also offering other things once it's out, and Leverage can give information on corp intention, as well as being a possible other method of issuing bad pub (especially against net-damage oriented Jinteki decks).<\/p>\n\n<p>Suggestions, comments, and criticism welcome.<\/p>\n","username":"skypidallius","cards":{"01022":3,"01031":1,"01032":2,"01047":1,"01051":1,"01052":3,"02069":3,"02091":2,"02105":1,"02109":1,"03054":3,"04004":3,"04049":1,"04062":2,"04083":1,"04089":3,"04106":3,"05028":1,"05031":3,"05037":3,"05041":1,"05042":1,"05046":1,"05050":2}},{"id":5217,"name":"Friendship Theory: You take hostages like a little girl","creation":"2014-05-07 15:54:15","description":"<p>Hi everyone!

It's fun! If I'm poor, I guess I could get a Pipeline, which cheaply is installed and makes it safe to run vs all that newfangled 'multi-sub murder tax ICE' that Jinteki got, like Tsurugi and Komainu. Yay, my Japanese Lessons sure did come in handy!<\/p>\n\n<p>Anyway, I'd first try to find my best friend Donut Tanganes, or if I can't find him, take a Hostage and threaten to kill bitches until I do. The second priority is to take hostages for my other friend, the Source, and be sure to set up a bunch of Fall Guys to protect The Source then suffer life in prison when I blame them for stealing Astroscript from NBN because they can't fast advance it enough. <\/p>\n\n<p>Finally, I hear lots of crazy things about this 'Cerebral Imaging' company, that apparently sets up absurd databases in HQ then accomplishes dozens of Agendas instantly! Well, against them, Donut simply utterly screws them, by making Green and Blue level clearance utterly useless. And by making all their econ crappy. Then I throw away my College Fund and vamp the company into the ground.<\/p>\n\n<p>Finally, my Cyber-Aspergers means I really should stay away from net damage, which is apparently all the rage in Japan. So I made a net shield out out of garbage and always will have a Deus X around to save my butt out of nowhere.<\/p>\n\n<p>Basically, that was my summer vacation.

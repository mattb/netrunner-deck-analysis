I've always liked control decks (came from magic) and I think if built right, this deck could do it.  <\/p>\n\n<p>My early runs would hopefully score some points and get good tempo.  I might really suffer the mid game but I'm hoping Kati jones and black guard will really get me home.<\/p>\n\n<p>This deck is modeled more after heartthrobs blackguard of the red queen deck(shout out to him).  I'm really hoping to put a lot of pressure on Hq and just keep me in their hand the whole time.  I wanted to include nerve agent in here but I'm not sure what to take out.  Modded seems like it would save me lots of time and money but 6 influence and 3 slots in a 40 card deck is hefty.  Thoughts?  I like levy at lab access...  One of my favorite cards and I could replace modded and include a different card in the third slot. <\/p>\n\n<p>The other major concern is that I only have 1 copy of each ice breaker.  I was thinking of dropping special order and other events to include two of each.  Alias, Breach, and passport will hopefully keep me in HQ to snipe some agendas and give me time to check what's being setup in remotes while blackguard and other ice breakers are being out out.<\/p>\n\n<p>I'm  thinking this will be a fun deck for me but I looking for suggestions and help from you pros out there.

Strong consideration needs to be given to the fact that Amazon + Blue Sun's ability = 1 Beanstalk Royalties with an entry barrier equal to the cost of the piece of ice, which in this deck could be as high as 14 credits. The draw though for AIZ is that, if left alone, it functions as this deck's version of the \"infinite Adonis\" that many Blue Sun decks are trying to pull off (cute, but not worth the influence\/ice protection; Weyland has been doing just fine without Adonis Campaign up until this point). It's true that Amazon, even while protected by Off The Grid, won't yield as much money as quickly. At a rez of 4, and a net of 3 from Blue Sun, it wouldn't be until the third piece of ice you return that you get profit greater than the one-click pop of a Beanstalk. So why include it?<\/p>\n\n<p>Tempo. For the first time, Weyland has the pieces to establish a longer form of tempo and set the pace of the game. Whereas before, tempo in most Weyland match-ups was dictated by how quickly the runner hit a Snare, or how many juicy programs they had out when they face-checked that Archer, this deck can force the runner over multiple turns into a series of lose-lose situations. Crisium Grid is the key to making this happen. In order to trash off the grid, the runner must first make a run on HQ (which you can load with taxing\/tagging ice), trash Crisium, and then make another successful run back through. With two Data Ravens over HQ, the runner has to end the turn with a tag providing they don't have an NACH on the table. And an early Data Raven over an Amazon Industrial Zone will force the runner to deal with both the trash and the tag, or risk letting you have what has become the new version of Weyland drip econ.<\/p>\n\n<p>I don't know yet whether it's wrong to leave out Oversight AI here because it is a bunch of free money (especially in the version of this deck that used to run Janus), but I'm trying this tax and tag variant for now and seeing what happens.

There was a series of turns where I needed to draw agendas and was not.<\/p>\n\n<p>2) One scored <a href=\"\/en\/card\/06001\">Domestic Sleepers<\/a> is enough with this agenda set, and 2 scored doesn't help the corp, so agenda composition is all 3 pointers and now 2 Domestic Sleepers.<\/p>\n\n<p>3) Aside from expensive \"one of's\", core ice should be pairs or triplets.<\/p>\n\n<p>4) Our identity increases agenda density because we remove extra ice from R&amp;D therefore defending it is important. (We have built in Indexing protection - with either unrezzed ice on R&amp;D or a <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02060\">Chimera<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n<p>5) Grail ice with this identity will be effective because ice in hand are never dead cards. NEXT and Grail together with <a href=\"\/en\/card\/06010\">Mother Goddess<\/a> will be very efficient and effective.<\/p>\n\n<p>6) This identity naturally protects HQ because extra ice can just be held to make space. (<a href=\"\/en\/card\/04012\">Celebrity Gift<\/a> is an economy option)<\/p>\n\n<p>7) Our identity wants to rez ice, which means the runner needs to run. If the runner tries to just focus one server they can potentially deplete money and then pressure other servers unhindered.  <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02038\">Amazon Industrial Zone<\/a> counters this, allowing the ability to proc on the runner AND corp's turn. It is also a nice economy option and can get an oppressive scoring remote established.<\/p>\n\n<p>8) This identity can theoretically allow us to run fewer ice and be fine, thus freeing up deck slots. Someone with a more mathematical mind than me should crunch some numbers.<\/p>\n\n<p>Economy: Since this is a Red Coats style deck, and is not HB:EtF,  extra economy cards were added. Sometimes the game state demands the corp \"turtle up\" so aside from installing ice, the economy should be click efficient. <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01056\">Adonis Campaign<\/a> requires no clicks to use and can be initially set up in a scoring server. Same with <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02059\">Private Contracts<\/a> except you can control how quickly you drain it and is also effective in a scoring server. <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01108\">Melange Mining Corp.<\/a> is an experiment, but it forces the runner to deal with it, which means you will probably rez ice to defend it.<\/p>\n\n<p>UPGRADES: <\/p>\n\n<p>v2.1 - With First Contact dropping in a few days, I have made some updates. I have taken out <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02110\">Eli 1.0<\/a> to try out <a href=\"\/en\/card\/06011\">Galahad<\/a> and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/06051\">Lancelot<\/a>. Doing so required me to cut <a href=\"\/en\/card\/05012\">Tenma Line<\/a>. I only drew it once or twice in testing and I never needed to use it. <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04079\">Punitive Counterstrike<\/a> has killed several unsuspecting runners.  Sometimes 2 are required to flat line the runner, so I have increased the count to 3. I ran into an issue of drawing all of the Ichi's and Inazuma while needing ETR ice. With the shift towards Grail ice, Inazuma has been taken out. I have also dropped down to 2 <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02038\">Amazon Industrial Zone<\/a>, because they are obnoxious to draw when there is an established scoring remote and I'm click-drawing for agendas.  <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04090\">Blue Level Clearance<\/a> has performed admirably, however I feel 2 is still the correct number.

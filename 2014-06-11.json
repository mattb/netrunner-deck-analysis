The idea is to just turbo out as many viruses as possible in one shot and hit archives. JackHo may save agendas but the disruption to their deck will slow them down a lot. Now they haveto choose where their dwindling ICE is going. Heavily protect archives? Medium\/Nerve agent them. Protect HQ\/R&amp;D\/remote? Mill them and hit archives. Scheharazade keeps your econ solid and you don't care if it gets trashed since you're not putting Femme on it. If you're actually using medium\/nerve agent for more than a mill, don't put them on it either. Draw, mass install, femme into archives, sell to Aesops, deja vulnerable, etc, etc. When the criminal virus that gives you 3c from hosted counters comes out I'll be putting it in. I also plan to try and fit Duggars and Joshua B and Rachel Beckman. Doubt I'll be able to but the idea of a six click turn of drawing with Duggars, mass installing, and running archives, appeals to me.<br \/>\nI haven't playtested this yet but I've been using multiple Femme in my shaper deck and they've been doing well. I think they'll do the same here since you're disrupting the opponents deck much they're forced to choose where to protect. Jinteki low ICE decks seem especially vulnerable to this. Femme bypasses Komainu for free, allows you to ignore inuzama\/chum, breaks guard, bypasses Mother Goddess\/Chimera, etc.\nAny constructive criticism is welcome.

Even if there are two plascretes out, you can blow through them both, and the runner too.  Obviously there are hard counters to this deck (3 x Plascrete, or Decoy, or NACH, or a super-rich runner), but we are hoping that our runner opponents won't be playing those cards, and won't know what we are up to until it is too late.<\/p>\n\n<p>The BIG combo requires 21 credits plus whatever the runner has (creds + link), and the three key combo pieces in hand, Accelerated Diagnostics, Power Shutdown, and Jackson Howard.  It is done as follows:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Install Jackson #1<\/li>\n<li>Power Shutdown the whole deck<\/li>\n<li>AD for Interns (Jackson #2), Reclamation Order (ADx3), Biotic<\/li>\n<li>AD for Interns (Jackson #3), SEA, Scorch<\/li>\n<li>AD for Scorch, Scorch, Scorch<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Note that you cannot use Jackson Howard during the game to recycle cards, otherwise the combo is wrecked.  If a card you need for the combo is in hand, use Subliminal Messaging in its place in the combo to give you an extra click to play it out of hand.  Of course, shorter combos are possible if you don't need to deal 16 meat damage and you don't have enough credits.  Here are the main combo thresholds, although you might need to adjust these somewhat if you have to or can play cards out of hand, or have Jackson already in play.<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>16 Meat Damage - LINK + 21 Credits (see above)<\/li>\n<li>12 Meat Damage - LINK + 14 Credits (use Hedge Fund instead of 1st Scorch)<\/li>\n<li>8 Meat Damage - LINK + 8 Credits (Sea+2xScorch with 1st AD)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Why Custom Biotics?  You need 3 x Scorched Earth, 3 x Jackson, 3 x Accelerated Diagnostics, and at least 2 x Power Shutdowns to pull off the combo reliably.  Not possible with any other IDs other than Weyland, but Weyland is missing some other useful stuff, like Archived Memories and Reclamation Order, which make things a lot easier.<\/p>\n\n<p>Why a 59 card deck?  The combo pieces use up a lot of deck space, and once you put in agendas and an acceptable amount of ICE, there isn't enough space left for economy, of which you need lots.  With a bigger deck, the combo package takes up a smaller portion of the deck, leaving you with more space to insert economy cards.  Also, a 59 card deck requires 24 minimum agenda points, which is divisible by 3, meaning you can get away with only 8 agendas.  8\/59 is pretty much the lowest possible agenda density, and the runner will need to hit 3 to win.  Also, after reworking a few agendas back into the deck, the agenda density will increase, but having a larger deck mitigates the effect of this.<\/p>\n\n<p>Rework - since you are collecting combo pieces in your hand, that leaves less space for agendas.  Reworks are maximally efficient in this deck, as they are sending back 3 point agendas, and they can be recycled with Archived Memories or Reclamation Order.  Remember, you can't use Jacksons to do this, because you need them for the big combo.<\/p>\n\n<p>Research Station - This is experimental, but I think a larger hand size could benefit this deck quite a bit, as you will probably be holding 3 combo pieces for much of the game as you build up your credit level.  Closed Accounts is an alternative, since you can recur it, but Scorched Earth (also can be recurred) is probably good enough punishment for tags, Closed Accounts is probably overkill.<\/p>\n\n<p>ICE - I just threw together a bunch of random ice without too much thought, I will adjust the mix in the future after play testing for a while.<\/p>\n","username":"joemillions","cards":{"01058":3,"01059":1,"01061":1,"01062":2,"01064":1,"01086":1,"01099":3,"01105":1,"01106":3,"01110":3,"01113":1,"02039":2,"02052":1,"02093":2,"02110":3,"03002":1,"03006":3,"03019":2,"03026":1,"04015":3,"04040":3,"04052":3,"04058":2,"04060":1,"04090":3,"04100":1,"04111":3,"04120":3,"05024":1,"05025":2}},{"id":6626,"name":"tryhard encryption+MHC+good ICE","creation":"2014-06-11 09:49:54","description":"<p>cut 2 adonis campaigns for +1 eli and +3 roto <\/p>\n","username":"Milchtee","cards":{"01056":1,"01064":3,"01081":3,"01082":2,"01090":2,"01092":3,"01109":3,"01110":3,"01111":2,"02029":3,"02056":3,"02110":3,"02115":3,"04015":3,"04076":3,"04096":2,"04100":1,"04119":3,"05009":3,"06005":1}},{"id":6627,"name":"Accelerated Double Time Deck","creation":"2014-06-11 11:08:34","description":"<p>Idea is to use accelerated beta test\/diagnostics to get some wild turns with a precognition to setup the play or interns\/reclamation  to reuse or reclaim cards Jackson to shuffle cards back in.<\/p>\n\n<p>SanSan is in for use with efficiency \/ diagnostics\nsubliminal and pop up's help sustain econ.<\/p>\n\n<p>Sherlock to tax or screw over programs (mainly virus's) and Ichi to trash programs.<\/p>\n\n<p>So far the decks been doing very well.<\/p>\n","username":"Pinkwarrior","cards":{"01054":1,"01055":3,"01061":3,"01062":1,"01073":2,"01090":1,"01110":3,"02030":2,"02051":3,"02052":3,"02056":2,"02110":3,"03005":3,"03011":1,"04015":2,"04034":3,"04052":3,"04060":2,"04090":3,"04100":1,"04111":2,"04119":1,"05024":2}},{"id":6628,"name":"Grendel No Shin","creation":"2014-06-11 11:35:37","description":"\n","username":"vgarodrigues","cards":{"01069":2,"01083":2,"01094":3,"01101":2,"01102":3,"01103":2,"01110":3,"02018":3,"02020":2,"02057":2,"02060":3,"02080":3,"04017":3,"04040":3,"04097":1,"04098":2,"04117":3,"04118":2,"05015":3,"05023":3}},{"id":6629,"name":"I have no idea what I am doing","creation":"2014-06-11 11:39:04","description":"<p>Really I do not. this is just the first thing that comes to mind when I think of Nasir<\/p>\n","username":"CodeMarvelous","cards":{"01005":3,"01026":2,"01034":3,"01043":2,"01044":3,"01050":3,"02002":2,"02027":2,"02028":2,"02049":3,"02066":1,"02082":3,"02087":2,"02091":3,"02106":3,"02107":2,"03038":3,"03046":2,"04067":1,"06017":1}},{"id":6630,"name":"Kit peddler ","creation":"2014-06-11 13:04:54","description":"\n","username":"Link","cards":{"01007":1,"01014":3,"01026":3,"01040":3,"01050":3,"02041":1,"02047":3,"02048":3,"02049":3,"02091":2,"02107":3,"03028":1,"03031":1,"03034":3,"03035":1,"03037":1,"03039":1,"03049":3,"03053":3,"04086":2,"04108":2}},{"id":6631,"name":"Blackmail noise","creation":"2014-06-11 13:08:41","description":"\n","username":"Link","cards":{"01001":1,"01002":3,"01006":2,"01007":1,"01008":3,"01009":2,"01010":3,"01011":1,"01012":3,"01016":2,"01047":2,"02003":3,"02041":1,"02042":2,"02067":3,"03047":2,"03054":3,"04001":3,"04043":3,"04089":3}},{"id":6632,"name":"fast deck","creation":"2014-06-11 13:12:12","description":"\n","username":"Link","cards":{"01059":2,"01103":2,"01110":3,"01111":2,"02014":3,"02033":3,"04012":3,"04013":2,"04015":2,"04032":2,"04059":3,"05001":1,"05005":3,"05006":1,"05007":1,"05009":3,"05011":1,"05014":3,"05017":2,"05018":3}},{"id":6633,"name":"Next Shut Down","creation":"2014-06-11 13:19:01","description":"<p>A lot of ice, decent econ and the best agenda for feeding archer: Domestic Sleepers.<\/p>\n","username":"CodeMarvelous","cards":{"01055":3,"01056":2,"01064":3,"01090":1,"01101":1,"01106":2,"01110":3,"01113":3,"02051":3,"02070":3,"03003":1,"04011":3,"04015":2,"04058":2,"04096":2,"04100":2,"04119":1,"04120":3,"05024":3,"06001":2,"06002":3,"06010":2}},{"id":6634,"name":"The World is Not Enough v2","creation":"2014-06-11 13:23:00","description":"<p>This is derived from a deck that won a tournament just before the release of Fear and Loathing, and it was a super-fun, very powerful deck to play.

Very few fancy tricks, just taxing ice with a heavy focus on ETR. There's a hefty range of low-cost ice to better guarantee a good start for the ID, and plenty of mid-to-high range ice to strengthen your servers later.<\/p>\n\n<p>The best strategies these days largely depend on the runner, but the general idea is to lay out some cheap ice, hopefully three before the game begins. If you're lucky enough to draw up more ICE and an ABT, score it quickly. With 23 ICE in the deck, your odds are pretty good of getting at least two more out for free. <\/p>\n\n<p>Without ABT, hopefully you've got an Adonis or other econ to bulk up while you wait for a scoring window. An early power shutdown can help, especially against an over-aggressive criminal or parasite heavy decks. <\/p>\n\n<p>Archived memories is there to pull any cards out of archives that may have been lost to power shutdown, but generally this should only be used for agendas, other econ cards or NEXT ice.

The idea is simple: rush agendas hard.<\/p>\n\n<p>I focused on cheap ETR ice, or ones that offered unique defensive advantages. Wall of Thorns can be a great rez off an early Hedge Fund to either keep runners out of R&amp;D or create a scoring server. Never underestimate the 2 net damage they get from face-checking it, particularly on a tight clock. Inazuma Helps to \"reactivate\" ETR ice once the runner has a breaker, and Guard is a Sentry ETR that also keeps out Inside Job and Femme.<\/p>\n\n<p>Economy is focused on providing quick cash bursts to power scoring and to generate enough to rez a San San City Grid within the first 2-3 turns to power out agendas.<\/p>\n\n<p>Some plays that I've found effective within the deck:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Mushin No Shin + NAPD, then ice turn 1: Even if the Runner can get past the ice, they've usually spent enough money that they can't afford to steal the agenda. Leaves your R&amp;D vulnerable but you can score and be 1\/3 of the way to the win.<\/li>\n<li>Mushin No Shin + SanSan City Grid: Some people pull in Dues Ex, some draw up, but most people run it; most wont have 5 credits to loose trashing the SanSan, so they bounce and then have to figure out what to do. If you have Trick of Light in hand and 8 credits you can rez the SanSan, then ToL tokens to score a 2\/4 out of hand.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>In general the rest of the cards are there to slow down opponents: if they are trashing everything, drop more Mental Health Clinics and make them waste credits and clicks. If they hit everything you Mushin, Mushin a Shi.kyu and let them eat that.

It's better to layer it on your agenda server, to maximize your chance of rezzing a lot of NEXT ice at once. Of course, any rezzed non-MG ice will have to be McGuired back to HQ as soon as possible. Also consider using NEXT ice to protect Levy University or McGuire, and there's a decent chance the Runner will leave them alone entirely.<\/p>\n\n<p>Data Mine is for stopping Inside Job without giving MG any of the three basic subtypes, and Swordsman is for stopping AI-heavy runners.

Wish I could edit the published list ;)<\/p>\n","username":"ExplodyCat","cards":{"01055":3,"01056":3,"01058":3,"01062":3,"01065":2,"01099":2,"01101":3,"01104":2,"01108":2,"01110":3,"02051":3,"02110":3,"03002":1,"03005":3,"03017":3,"04011":3,"04015":2,"04111":1,"04119":3,"04120":2,"06001":3,"06002":3,"06006":2,"06012":2}},{"id":6652,"name":"Iain's former contacts 1.0","creation":"2014-06-11 21:30:09","description":"\n","username":"squirtlesquad","cards":{"01007":2,"01018":3,"01022":3,"01031":1,"01032":3,"01050":3,"01052":2,"02007":2,"02009":2,"02025":3,"02069":3,"02091":1,"02105":1,"03055":1,"04004":3,"04065":2,"04106":3,"05028":1,"05031":3,"05037":2,"05050":3}},{"id":6653,"name":"San Antonio Regional 3rd Place - Corp","creation":"2014-06-11 22:12:35","description":"<p>Allen H. took this to 3rd place at the 2014 San Antonio regional.<\/p>\n","username":"keggy","cards":{"01054":1,"01055":3,"01056":3,"01061":1,"01062":2,"01090":3,"01106":3,"01110":3,"02013":3,"02019":3,"02092":3,"02110":3,"03006":1,"03015":2,"03019":3,"04011":3,"04015":3,"04030":1,"04040":3,"04100":2,"04119":1}},{"id":6654,"name":"San Antonio Regional 3rd Place - Runner","creation":"2014-06-11 22:12:49","description":"<p>Allen H. took this to 3rd place at the 2014 San Antonio regional.<\/p>\n","username":"keggy","cards":{"01007":1,"01008":2,"01012":1,"01024":2,"01026":1,"01033":1,"01034":3,"01038":2,"01050":3,"02009":2,"02041":1,"02066":1,"02087":2,"02091":3,"02106":2,"02107":2,"03035":1,"03038":3,"03040":2,"03044":2,"03046":3,"03052":2,"03053":3,"04067":1}},{"id":6655,"name":"San Antonio Regional 4th Place - Corp","creation":"2014-06-11 22:12:57","description":"<p>Chris H. took this to 4th place at the 2014 San Antonio regional.<\/p>\n","username":"keggy","cards":{"01059":2,"01081":3,"01082":2,"01090":1,"01092":3,"01110":3,"02056":2,"02060":2,"02110":2,"02114":1,"02115":3,"04015":2,"04020":2,"04034":2,"04076":3,"04077":1,"04096":2,"04119":2,"04120":2,"05014":2,"05027":3}},{"id":6656,"name":"San Antonio Regional 4th Place - Runner","creation":"2014-06-11 22:13:07","description":"<p>Chris H. took this to 4th place at the 2014 San Antonio regional.<\/p>\n","username":"keggy","cards":{"01008":1,"01018":2,"01026":2,"01033":1,"01034":3,"01035":3,"01044":1,"01050":3,"02009":2,"02047":2,"02066":1,"02106":2,"02107":2,"03034":2,"03035":2,"03038":3,"03040":2,"03046":3,"03048":1,"03054":3,"04067":1,"04086":2,"05036":2}},{"id":6657,"name":"San Antonio Regional 5th Place - Corp","creation":"2014-06-11 22:13:16","description":"<p>David H. took this to 5th place at the 2014 San Antonio regional.<\/p>\n","username":"keggy","cards":{"01059":2,"01080":1,"01081":3,"01082":2,"01084":2,"01090":2,"01092":3,"01110":3,"02017":2,"02019":2,"02020":2,"02052":1,"02056":2,"02097":1,"02110":2,"02115":3,"04015":3,"04034":2,"04076":3,"04096":2,"04119":3,"04120":2,"05027":2}},{"id":6658,"name":"San Antonio Regional 5th Place - Runner","creation":"2014-06-11 22:13:26","description":"<p>David H. took this to 5th place at the 2014 San Antonio regional.<\/p>\n","username":"keggy","cards":{"01007":1,"01008":3,"01014":1,"01018":3,"01021":2,"01022":3,"01024":3,"01026":1,"01029":1,"01030":1,"01045":1,"01050":3,"02022":1,"02024":1,"02043":2,"02083":1,"02091":1,"02107":1,"03041":1,"03042":1,"03052":3,"03053":1,"03054":2,"04104":2,"05035":2,"05036":1,"05048":2,"05053":1}},{"id":6659,"name":"San Antonio Regional 6th Place - Corp","creation":"2014-06-11 22:13:39","description":"<p>Austin N. took this to 6th place at the 2014 San Antonio regional.<\/p>\n","username":"keggy","cards":{"01070":2,"01080":1,"01081":3,"01082":2,"01084":2,"01090":2,"01092":3,"01104":2,"01110":3,"02017":2,"02019":3,"02020":2,"02052":3,"02056":1,"02097":2,"02115":3,"04015":3,"04076":3,"04096":3,"04100":2,"04119":3}},{"id":6660,"name":"San Antonio Regional 6th Place - Runner","creation":"2014-06-11 22:13:53","description":"<p>Austin N. took this to 6th place at the 2014 San Antonio regional.<\/p>\n","username":"keggy","cards":{"01007":2,"01008":2,"01011":1,"01017":1,"01018":3,"01021":2,"01022":3,"01024":3,"01026":1,"01028":3,"01043":2,"01050":3,"02009":2,"02043":3,"02085":1,"02091":2,"02104":3,"02107":1,"03052":3,"03053":3,"03054":2}},{"id":6661,"name":"San Antonio Regional 7th Place - Corp","creation":"2014-06-11 22:14:04","description":"<p>Cal M. took this to 7th place at the 2014 San Antonio regional.<\/p>\n","username":"keggy","cards":{"01055":3,"01058":2,"01059":3,"01062":1,"01064":2,"01090":1,"01110":3,"02051":3,"02052":2,"02070":1,"02110":2,"03001":1,"03005":3,"03017":1,"03019":3,"03026":1,"04012":2,"04034":3,"04040":3,"04090":3,"04100":2,"04111":2,"04117":2,"04119":1}},{"id":6662,"name":"San Antonio Regional 7th Place - Runner","creation":"2014-06-11 22:15:37","description":"<p>Cal M. took this to 7th place at the 2014 San Antonio regional.\nDecklist appears to be illegal, his sheet says that there is a 3rd cyberfeeder, putting him at 16 influence.

A couple recent changes have really kicked it into high gear and made it much more successful.<\/p>\n\n<p>The idea behind the deck is to tax the runner and NEVER give them an effective opportunity to use Account Siphon. The deck accomplishes this in a few ways<\/p>\n\n<p>1) Unrezzed Eve Campaigns<\/p>\n\n<p>2) Cheap ETR ice (paper wall, quandry, and draco all typically go on HQ.) Against a criminal who keeps hitting HQ and trying to get the ice rezzed, I'll often put 3 ice on HQ.<\/p>\n\n<p>3) The Eve's, over the course of the game, provide a pretty overwhelming economic advantage. By the end of the game, even if the criminal could get in, losing 5 credits is not a big deal. It is not uncommon for this deck to have 30-40 credits.<\/p>\n\n<p>4) Caprise on HQ. It isn't ideal (I prefer one on R&amp;D and\/or the remote) but if I was worried about Siphon I would put it there.<\/p>\n\n<p>Why Stronger Together?<\/p>\n\n<p>Lots of reasons<\/p>\n\n<p>1) Viktor 1.0 becomes unYog-able. Without that weakness, Vitkor 1.0 becomes a very cheap, annoying card.<\/p>\n\n<p>2) Extra cost to break Eli with Corroder is also very taxing. 5 cost to break a 3 cost ice? Ridiculous.<\/p>\n\n<p>3) Heimdall 2.0 becomes immune to Knight (VERY IMPORTANT!!)<\/p>\n\n<p>The result of the increased strength of the bioroids is more than just +1 cost to break. It often makes the difference between not being able to get into the server at all.<\/p>\n\n<p>Weaknesses:<\/p>\n\n<p>1) This deck often gets behind early because of runs on R&amp;D can be clicked through (end the run ice is usually reserved for HQ and remotes) While I am usually happy to see someone run and click through Viktor or Eli, you can give up agendas early on. I usually get to a point where the runner just can not get in anywhere (I've IAA an agenda into my remote, and the runner knows he can't get there, or R&amp;D, or HQ the next turn.)<\/p>\n\n<p>2) Opus: Opus gives the runner to make a run on any server every other turn. This means that scoring a 5\/3 can't happen with Carprise help (unless you can draw a run on an agg sec.) I haven't seen any other economy able to make anything close to sustained runs on this deck.<\/p>\n\n<p>3) I don't know how common this is, but I kept losing to a Whizzard DLR deck a friend of mine played. It could be the deck weakness or it could be my lack of experience playing against it. But Whizzard definitely hurts the economy of this deck by trashing the Eves<\/p>\n\n<p>Other points:<\/p>\n\n<p>1) Caprise is really demoralizing in this deck. Putting Carpise on R&amp;D behind 4 or 5 ice just makes the runner die inside. May change if S&amp;W becomes a thing (as at the end of the game HQ is usually the least expensive server to run.<\/p>\n\n<p>2) Don't bother protecting the Eves at all (except maybe against Whizard with a single ice)<\/p>\n\n<p>3) I will usually put Wotan or Heimdall 2.0 on R&amp;D early to be rezzed by a Pri Req (defended by Heimdall or Wotan that I rez either naturally or with Bioroid efficiency committee.<\/p>\n\n<p>4) Power shutdowns are great for<\/p>\n\n<p>Fairies (to spook the runner and maybe activate a surprise Ichi or Roto!)\nDatasuckers (you don't want them getting through thos Viktor 1.0's!)\nCorroder (obviously)\nGordian (if splashed into Criminal)\nMagnum (if the runner puts Magnum out first, I am happy to trash 5 cards to get rid of it usually...hopefully I have a Jackson out.)<\/p>\n\n<p>Put ABT in your scoring remote, but don't score it. The runner will put you on an upgrade and you can leave it there until you get a jackson out.<\/p>\n\n<p>Keep in mind that these are trashes against the minimalist Criminal rig (that might have only one or two things out at a time. <\/p>\n\n<p>Play this deck, and laugh as you see the Siphons thrown in the heap.<\/p>\n\n<p>MWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!<\/p>\n","username":"theodorelogan","cards":{"01055":3,"01057":1,"01063":3,"01064":1,"01106":2,"01108":1,"01110":3,"02010":1,"02020":1,"02092":3,"02110":3,"03006":2,"03013":2,"03015":3,"03017":1,"03019":3,"03023":2,"04015":3,"04030":1,"04040":2,"04058":2,"04059":2,"04100":1,"04114":2,"04120":2}},{"id":4808,"name":"The Virus Peddler v1.2","creation":"2014-05-01 01:43:42","description":"\n","username":"Thike","cards":{"01006":2,"01008":1,"01012":1,"01026":1,"01034":3,"01036":3,"01040":2,"01050":3,"01051":1,"01053":3,"02007":1,"02047":3,"02091":2,"03028":1,"03031":1,"03035":1,"03038":3,"03043":1,"03046":3,"03048":1,"03052":3,"03054":2,"04006":3,"04108":1}},{"id":4809,"name":"Jenteki: Replicating Perfection, Tag and Bag","creation":"2014-05-01 01:49:41","description":"<p>This is the first deck I have built myself.

Deck aims to keep the corp poor with account siphons into tag-me anarch. <\/p>\n\n<p>If I see a data leak early (i.e. before an account siphon) it's easy to fall into the rhythm of taking a tag with John Masanori, milling 2 cards from R&amp;D, and then clear tags. Even better with hemorrhage (which was cut down to 1 copies to make room for plascrete for the published version of the deck, although I generally don't play with them, and decide what to take out day of (in this case a hemorrhage and a datasucker). You can either wait to see a plascrete before going tag me, or just be aggressive and hope you see a plascrete before the corp can get two scorched earths (or you see enough influence they can't be running scorched, etc.)<\/p>\n\n<p>Deck runs pretty hot, without account siphon you can be in economic turmoil, but luckily you can charge datasucker and hemorrhage for free, which helps alleviate some of that pain. Part of the reason Vamp got cut was that money was always tight if I didn't do it right after a siphon. <\/p>\n\n<p>Underworld contact is a new addition, it\u2019s definitely going to need testing, and is not the most exciting card for the deck, but there will almost always be higher value trashes than underworld, and since keeping the corp trashing is a big part of the core strategy, it generally feels about as useful as an Armitage that gets trashed with most of the cash still on it (I only stop to pull all the money off them if the corp can tell I'm strapped for cash). <\/p>\n\n<p>Common weaknesses: The deck does a really good job keeping the corp hungry for credits, but one good turn of burst from them and I have a hard time gaining my dominance back, generally requiring a double siphon to get them back into the red. <\/p>\n\n<p>Like I said, I tend to run pretty low on credits, chaining account siphons being the preferred method of economy. <\/p>\n\n<p>Strengths: You spread the corp VERY thin, all naked servers, especially archives, are a liability. John Masanori and Hemorrhage make trashing a naked asset or upgrade much more painless.<\/p>\n\n<p>When the corp is down, it hurts a lot. It is very easy to string together multiple turns of \"gain 1, gain 1, trash resource\", and if they need to clear out datasuckers, forcing a number of wasted turns, or heavy punishment if I get to use DLR for 2+ turns in a row. For this reason, I used to play fall guy, but found that, while it was a 0 cost resource that the corp had to trash, it practically never protected cards for an extra turn, the corp opting instead to simply trash it when they were flush with cash, or biting the bullet to spend 4 and 2 clicks (effectively) to trash DLR. Good, but generally lackluster.

Your goal is to rush out two Agendas before the runner can score them -- no easy task, but not utterly impossible. The Future Perfect is somewhat safe until you install it, which gives you something of an edge.<\/p>\n\n<p>There are three main plans, as I see them, with this deck.:\n-Use Mushin\/SfSS to score big Agendas on the cheap.\n-Use Aggressive Secretary and Grim to reset the runner's rig\n-Get the runner to access and take on a Shi Kyu, so that they have to score fully half of your Agendas.<\/p>\n\n<p>The first two plans support each other fairly effectively -- put Grim in front of servers they'll need to run so that the cheap ETR can keep them out. Use Aggressive Secretary if they're too set up for Grim to work.<\/p>\n\n<p>Mushin should USUALLY be followed up by placing Ice in front, as it MUST create a new server, and leaving something empty is asking for trouble (either the runner nabbing your Agenda or ignoring your trap, and if there's a 50\/50 chance, it'll be the one you don't want). If you want to play mindgames, feel free -- but that's not the point. Aggressive Secretary is something they'll be pressured into running -- and if they don't, trick of light can recoup some of the sunk costs.<\/p>\n\n<p>The last strategy is the reason for Inazuma and Susanoo-no-Mikoto. Both FORCE the runner to access archives if there isn't Ice behind them, and both are more than capable of sticking a hit, at least once. If you've got 2-3 Shocks there, Shi Kyu becomes much cheaper, and more likely to land. I'd suggest dumping Shocks first, then the Shi Kyu, so it can keep your hand safe, but if they run into them in R&amp;D, they'll be harder to trick.<\/p>\n\n<p>I'm not entirely settled on the econ or Ice, just yet, but I haven't had the chance to test it out much, and I <em>think<\/em> this is going to be potentially very fun to play. Goldfishing has shown that the actual biggest problem is drawing an Agenda in time for your scoring windows -- especially early. <\/p>\n\n<p>I might add another Fast Track to help manage that, but it's much less helpful here than in decks where it can lead to scoring that same turn, or even the next. Here, unless you follow-up by Mushinning out an Agenda (that you've just revealed) naked, there's no way to get the points to score it next turn, as there're no Biotic Labors to work with. If that prove to be a problem, I'll try to find a way to slot one in -- removing a Secretary and... I'm not sure what else -- to do it. Two would be pretty close to impossible, I think, without cutting heavily into econ\/consistency\/reset support, all of which seem equally necessary.<\/p>\n\n<p>Medical Research Fundraiser might be tolerable in this deck, I'll have to see if the econ demands its inclusion. Mental Health Clinic appeals, but will get trashed on install, I'd assume. Still, a way to use a former scoring server, perhaps.<\/p>\n","username":"GreatGreedyGuts","cards":{"01057":3,"01103":2,"01110":3,"02033":2,"02039":3,"02060":1,"04012":2,"04013":1,"04015":2,"04020":2,"04034":2,"04073":3,"04093":1,"04114":1,"04120":3,"05001":1,"05007":3,"05011":2,"05015":2,"05016":1,"05020":1,"05024":2,"05027":2}},{"id":4852,"name":"Red Coats H&P","creation":"2014-05-01 16:55:50","description":"<p>This deck hates on yog so hard.

Using Overmind, Knight, D4V1D, and your ability, you can get through pretty much anything. Cyberfeeders allow for more liberal use of Overmind, and allows you to install Cache for good returns. It's all tied in with Aesop's Pawnshop to sell all those used up Overmind, D4V1D, Daily Casts, and Caches. The Paper Tripping and Plascrete Carapace are obviously a meta-call, and Djinn, Mimic, and another Deja Vu should be considered for swap-ins.<\/p>\n\n<p>Playing it, Overmind is very important, try not to use counters where you could use credits. Memory is also an issue, you'll be juggling around breakers and programs waiting to sell stuff on Aesop's, so if you're unfamiliar with the deck, you may run into issues just timing everything. The deck runs on a timer so wants to win quickly, options do dwindle rapidly as it goes on.<\/p>\n","username":"MadeOfMush","cards":{"01002":2,"01005":3,"01010":2,"01012":3,"01016":3,"01047":3,"01050":3,"02009":2,"02024":2,"02041":1,"03052":3,"03053":3,"04042":2,"04043":2,"05053":3,"06015":1,"06033":2,"06034":2,"06037":3,"06052":1}},{"id":9553,"name":"mill noise 4","creation":"2014-09-14 23:04:06","description":"<p>noob deck, ignore<\/p>\n","username":"ronnoc1991","cards":{"01001":1,"01002":2,"01003":1,"01004":1,"01006":1,"01008":2,"01009":2,"01010":2,"01012":3,"01013":1,"01015":1,"01016":1,"01047":1,"01050":3,"01051":1,"02003":3,"02022":1,"02041":2,"02050":2,"02081":1,"02090":1,"03035":1,"03038":2,"03047":3,"03053":3,"04022":1,"04043":3}}]

Found here: http:\/\/netrunnerdb.com\/en\/decklist\/2975\/the-next-wall-v1-1<\/p>\n\n<p>Biggest changes:\nIce: I made a bigger difference between my types of ICE. Cheap Binairy ICE next to more expensive mid game ICE. I've mostly left out the really big players like Wotan and Janus, because building mutiple levels of cheaper ICE with different subtypes is IMO just a lot better. I'd like to exchange another Viper for a Rototurrent, but don't have the card for that. I'll have to borrow it sometime.<\/p>\n\n<p>Agenda's: Big overhaul here. Project Wotan is fun and stuff (especially if you add 6 subroutines to a card), but 3\/5 agenda's is just too much for this deck. Threw them out, loaded up on the Gila hands for econ. Switched Efficiency committee for NAPD contract to tax the runner. As a 2\/4 agenda it proved to be more of a hassle than a true boon, might as well make the runner pay to let him score.<\/p>\n\n<p>Assets and Operations: The previous deck was too basic. My econ was already quite big and cards like Successful Demonstration have a good turnover, but it sucks to have a condition on a econ card. Eve campaign was too slow for my tastes and with Gila Hands I could diversify my bag of tricks. Of course the most logical step would be more +1 click cards. Threw in 2x Biotic Labour and 2x Director Haas. Made the deck a lot faster. Once Haas is on the table and you've got SanSan in your hand, scoring agendas becomes cheap as chips.<\/p>\n\n<p>I'm probably not going to change much to this deck until a few more expansions are out (unless somebody has a good suggestion). I'm still waiting for more NEXT ice.

I decided on building a deck around the \"Rec-Cred Hardware\" - Lockpick, Silencer and Cyberfeeder. The Toolbox and Cloak had to go in, to play to the theme, and yge deck came to life.<\/p>\n\n<p>ECONOMY\n3x Sure Gamble\n3x Armatige Codebusting\nAesop's Pawnshop\nMany recurring credits. <\/p>\n\n<p>Using Mac, the deck has very few major installation expenses - aside from The Toolbox,  the worst it has is SMC into Gordian blade for 6cr. Runs are going to be cheap, if not free, with a full build offering me up to 14 rec-cr per turn to throw into them.\nNormally,  I staple Magnum Opus into a shaper deck, but with the above in mind, I decided that Armatige would be enough. Aesop's went in to eat the Replicators and Inside Mans when I was finished with them (and give me that cheeky extra credit from Armatige,  if need be).<\/p>\n\n<p>CARD DRAW\n3x Diesel\n3x Replicator<\/p>\n\n<p>Again, the deck is light. In theory, finding one Replicator will help thin the deck of the hardware I don't need, helping me draw cards that I do.<\/p>\n\n<p>ICEBREAKERS\nCorroder\nGordian Blade\nDagger<\/p>\n\n<p>I'm not 100% sure about this one. To play to the theme of the deck, I wanted icebreakers that can sit on Omni-Drive, which rules out Battering Ram. Only including one of each means I'm relying on SMC, and am vulnerable to damage - which is why Clone Chip went in.\nDeus X features,  but mostly for its Net Damage protection. <\/p>\n\n<p>SUPPORT\n3x Inside Man\n3x Clone Chip\n3x R&amp;D interface\nLevy AR Lab Access<\/p>\n\n<p>Clone Chip has already been discussed briefly - but it also helps with multi-SMC uses, as well as helping shift icebreakers onto Omni-Drive.\nInside Man I'm not sure of - while I have fist fulls of hardware to lay down, Mac is great at getting it done herself. At the very least,  he's Aesop food.\nR&amp;D Interface seems staple. Its hardware, and it helps me make minimal runs on R&amp;D (potentially only needing a run every few turns), allowing me to more comfortably hit HQ or remotes.<\/p>\n\n<p>FINAL THOUGHTS\nThe deck may suffer against Net damage decks, or Weyland Cleaner decks - Plascrete carapace could go in (more hardware!). The lower scale icebreakers may suffer against heavier ice, but with so many Rec-Creds, it'll hopefully still be cheap on the \"real' credit cost.\nI worry the economy is a little TOO light.  Testing will tell. <\/p>\n","username":"Butler223","cards":{"01005":3,"01007":1,"01033":1,"01034":3,"01041":1,"01043":1,"01047":1,"01050":3,"01053":3,"02066":1,"02068":3,"02088":3,"02107":3,"03035":1,"03038":3,"03039":3,"03041":3,"03042":1,"03046":3,"04006":3,"04104":3}},{"id":3911,"name":"Kate Cheap Deck","creation":"2014-04-06 08:13:16","description":"<p>This deck has been working out pretty well all my runs are super cheap and with replicator things go down incredibly fast<\/p>\n","username":"CodeMarvelous","cards":{"01005":3,"01033":1,"01034":3,"01038":3,"01047":1,"01050":3,"02007":2,"02009":2,"02027":2,"02047":3,"02088":2,"02091":2,"02107":3,"03041":3,"03042":3,"03046":1,"03049":3,"04006":2,"04103":2,"04104":2}},{"id":3912,"name":"Tennin Institute: How to Disappear Completely","creation":"2014-04-06 10:31:45","description":"<p>A single-remote, off-the-grid never-advance deck that tries to make running as unappealing as possible to cash in on Tennin's free advancements.<\/p>\n","username":"scumblr","cards":{"01064":2,"01068":3,"01075":2,"01078":2,"01079":2,"01110":3,"01111":2,"02014":3,"02034":2,"02070":3,"04012":3,"04038":2,"04059":2,"04060":2,"04074":2,"04100":3,"04111":2,"04114":2,"04115":2,"05003":1,"05006":1,"05007":2,"05017":2}},{"id":3913,"name":"Kate Imaginary Money","creation":"2014-04-06 11:00:34","description":"\n","username":"CodeMarvelous","cards":{"01005":3,"01033":1,"01034":3,"01038":3,"01041":2,"01047":1,"01050":3,"02007":2,"02009":2,"02027":2,"02088":3,"02091":2,"02107":3,"03041":3,"03042":2,"03046":2,"03049":3,"04006":2,"04103":2,"04104":2}},{"id":3914,"name":"Tennin Institute: How to Disappear Completely v1.1","creation":"2014-04-06 12:48:31","description":"<p>A single-remote, off-the-grid never-advance deck that tries to make running as unappealing as possible to cash in on Tennin's free advancements.<\/p>\n","username":"scumblr","cards":{"01064":2,"01068":3,"01075":2,"01078":2,"01079":2,"01110":3,"01111":2,"02014":3,"02034":2,"02070":3,"02110":2,"04012":3,"04038":2,"04040":2,"04060":2,"04074":2,"04100":2,"04111":1,"04114":2,"04115":2,"05003":1,"05006":1,"05007":2,"05017":2}},{"id":3915,"name":"Bees in the Hot Tub","creation":"2014-04-06 14:51:26","description":"<p>Hb rush\/FA type build, tries to score an early executive retreat or over advanced Vitruvius.

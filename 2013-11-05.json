It works kinda like the Flytrap, in that it attempts to keep you tagged and locked by PSF, but it has a bunch of advantages.<br><br>One is that it can really steal the game under Tag-Me runners, by running and recursing psychographics. One combo is to simply use Efficiency Committee, Psychographics and Archived memories to score two agendas out of hand in one turn.<br><br>Another is, in case the runner has accumulated a decent number of tags, is to psychographics a Project Ares. It might make you poor, but if you hit the runner with a 9 counter Ares, when they don't expect it, it might give you precious time to rebuild or time to score PSF.<br><br>PSF + Efficiency Committee is also a nice combo. If you have those two scored and the runner is tagged, it's an instant kill unless they have meat damage protection. And even if they run caparace, you can just chip at it until it's gone, and flatline them the next round. <br><br>This deck in action: http:\/\/youtu.be\/eS1CeywDBoQ","username":"db0","cards":{"01056":3,"01058":3,"01064":3,"01084":1,"01085":2,"01087":1,"01104":3,"01107":3,"01109":3,"01110":3,"01111":1,"01113":2,"02051":2,"02052":2,"02092":3,"02110":2,"02116":2,"03002":1,"03005":3,"03017":1,"03019":1,"04010":2,"04015":3}},{"id":393,"name":"NEXT","creation":"2013-11-05 13:49:36","description":"","username":"experimilk","cards":{"01055":3,"01057":1,"01059":2,"01064":2,"01104":1,"01108":2,"01110":3,"01113":3,"02012":1,"02051":3,"02052":2,"02110":3,"02120":2,"03003":1,"03006":2,"03013":3,"03015":2,"03017":2,"03019":3,"04011":3,"04012":2,"04015":3,"04030":2,"04033":2,"04040":2}},{"id":394,"name":"NEXT","creation":"2013-11-05 13:51:33","description":"","username":"experimilk","cards":{"01055":3,"01057":2,"01059":2,"01064":2,"01104":1,"01108":2,"01110":3,"01113":3,"02012":1,"02051":3,"02052":2,"02110":3,"02120":2,"03003":1,"03006":2,"03013":2,"03015":2,"03017":2,"03019":3,"04011":3,"04012":2,"04015":3,"04030":2,"04033":2,"04040":2}},{"id":395,"name":"Supa Mill","creation":"2013-11-05 14:08:59","description":"","username":"djackman","cards":{"01001":1,"01002":3,"01006":3,"01008":3,"01009":3,"01010":1,"01012":3,"01018":2,"01044":3,"01050":3,"01051":3,"02003":2,"02009":2,"02021":1,"02041":1,"02065":1,"02081":2,"02103":3,"03052":3,"04009":3}},{"id":396,"name":"Big Bux Weyland","creation":"2013-11-05 22:14:14","description":"","username":"travisrchance","cards":{"01057":2,"01065":2,"01093":1,"01094":3,"01098":3,"01101":3,"01102":3,"01103":3,"01106":3,"01110":3,"01111":2,"02013":3,"02019":3,"02070":3,"02077":3,"02079":3,"03026":3,"03027":2,"04020":2}},{"id":397,"name":"Haas Bioroid","creation":"2013-11-05 22:48:17","description":"","username":"strig","cards":{"01054":1,"01055":3,"01056":3,"01057":1,"01058":1,"01059":3,"01060":1,"01061":1,"01062":3,"01063":1,"01064":1,"01066":1,"01085":1,"01092":1,"01106":3,"01107":3,"01108":3,"01109":3,"01110":3,"01111":3,"01112":3,"01113":3}},{"id":398,"name":"Blow it Up","creation":"2013-11-05 23:12:47","description":"A deck designed around ICE destruction rather than breaking. Parasite, Datasucker, SMC, and Clone Chip are your main tools of destruction. Atman is there to bail you out in the event you actually you need to deal with subroutines. Sahasrara is a huge econ boon as it essentially lets you pull out Parasite for free. <br><br>The biggest issue this deck has had so far is dealing with big ICE decks that can get their economy going.

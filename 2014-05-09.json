Some of these card choices are my usual favorite includes. The initial draft of this deck was inspired by Jamieson's \"In a Red Dress and Alone\". It was pretty messy, and doesn't much resemble this one anymore.<\/p>\n\n<p>The second draft was heavily, heavily tweaked to look more like Fjord's \"Dinomite\", minus the Account Siphon recursion. I appreciate that Fjord's deck gave up on the Motivation-Eureka combo, which often failed to fire for me. I also like the idea to throw away a dedicated sentry breaker and just go full Femme-o-Saurus. That, and Fjord's choice of Events is much tighter, so I pretty much ripped those off completely.<\/p>\n\n<p>I like deep digs, so I included more Interfaces. The choice to include the Unregistered S&amp;W '35 comes from the fact that Chaos Theory with a gun is probably the funniest card combination in Netrunner. That, and at the moment (H&amp;P has just come out) I'm concerned not only with Jacksons, but Caprices and Chairman Hiros.<\/p>\n\n<p>This deck draws cards furiously and installs a suite of Opus-Femme-Torch-Morning Star very quickly. It plays \"vanilla Netrunner\" at high speed. No weird tricks. Just breakers and an Opus, with the potential for deep digs.<\/p>\n\n<p>Let me know your thoughts. It's a work in progress, and feedback is appreciated. I really want to move this deck in a unique direction over time. Here are some ideas that I've been playing with:<\/p>\n\n<p>*Finding room for 1x Deus Ex (depending how popular Jinteki becomes)<\/p>\n\n<p>*Finding room for a second Levy (maybe)<\/p>\n\n<p>*Eliminating R&amp;D interfaces.

It plays in two phases.<\/p>\n\n<p>Nutshell:\nIt starts with an early agenda steal, and a logos install.  If some ice get rezzed, fine, use e-shutdown and crescentus with overmind to derez the ice in preparation for phase 2.  Once you have an agenda, build up money and dig for same old thing, blackmail, and frame job.  If the corp scores, they've just given you frame job with logos.  Begin the blackmail runs.<\/p>\n\n<p>Phase 1: \nPhase 1 is the desperate attempts to get an agenda.  Inside job HQ and RD to try to luck out.  Do this at all costs, if you must, use an overmind to get in.  If you get enough money to drop an interface, then do it, increase your chances of a score.  Once you've scored your agenda and installed logos you're prepared for Phase 2.  Phase 1 ends when you've frame job'ed the corp per above.<\/p>\n\n<p>Phase2:\nThe corp either removes the bad pub, or can't protect itself.  So you begin building mutli access and commence R&amp;D and HQ locking.  The source didn't make the cut, so FA is a threat.  Overmind protects for when you must run the remotes.  Luckily there is room for E3 to help save OM counters.  Iain's ability keeps you flush with credits working with Kati to power the OM.  Use crescentus to keep ice derezzed.  HQI and RDI allow you to sweep HQ and R&amp;D with impunity with blackmail runs.  You can use feint and inside job to shut down any ice that gets rezzed.  This counters the only known blackmail counters, (OAI and BER, also amazon industrial).  Planned assault and same old thing mean you have quick access to blackmail.  Levy keeps the pain-train trolling.<\/p>\n\n<p>Basically it removes ice like a blue\/control deck removes creatures in magic.<\/p>\n","username":"x3r0h0ur","cards":{"01004":1,"01021":3,"01050":3,"02009":2,"02024":3,"02043":3,"02065":3,"02085":3,"02091":3,"02107":2,"03035":1,"03054":3,"04001":1,"04089":3,"05028":1,"05034":2,"05036":3,"05037":3,"05053":3}},{"id":5351,"name":"Tainted Fun Bridge","creation":"2014-05-09 12:44:59","description":"\n","username":"Finvara","cards":{"01090":1,"01098":3,"01100":3,"01102":3,"01103":3,"01110":3,"02018":3,"02039":2,"02077":3,"02099":2,"03017":1,"04018":3,"04030":1,"04038":3,"04040":3,"04078":3,"04097":1,"04099":3,"04100":3,"04117":3}},{"id":5352,"name":"Iain Connections v 1.1","creation":"2014-05-09 12:48:31","description":"<p>awe<\/p>\n","username":"Ayotte","cards":{"01007":1,"01021":1,"01022":3,"01026":1,"01032":3,"01050":3,"01051":1,"02006":1,"02025":2,"02028":2,"02045":2,"02069":3,"02091":2,"02105":2,"03055":1,"04004":3,"04061":2,"04106":1,"05028":1,"05031":3,"05035":2,"05037":3,"05041":1,"05042":1,"05046":1}},{"id":5353,"name":"Activist Anarchist","creation":"2014-05-09 12:52:55","description":"<p>Fall Guy makes all those resources so good.

It solves many problems with regards to lack of tutors necessary to setup the perfect rig. It has great synergy with Queen's gambit, since it mitigates wrong guesses.<\/p>\n\n<p>Personal workshop and Aesop are also a lot more affordable now, since you only need to splash 1 copy of each in your deck. This means Wyldside is once again viable, and PW still works wonders with Anarch programs.<\/p>\n\n<p>The final card choice is 3x Sharpshooter. These are not always useful, but in certain matchups, they really help a lot. Whizzard typically has programs installed like Djinn or Datasucker very early on with no breakers installed, so not being able to run because you're scared of Destroyers suck. Sharpshooter solves that problem. Plus, ices like Archer and Ichi 2.0 are really annoying to break with Mimic anyway. You can always Aesop if you need to.<\/p>\n\n<p>The cyberfeeders are flexible and can be swapped with other options, such as Daily Casts. I think they do a decent job of making corroder and mimic breaks cheap, protects against power shutdown, and can be Aesop'd for money in emergencies.<\/p>\n\n<p>The Ice Carver is there as backup. The lack of Grimoire can hurt a bit for the Datasuckers and Parasites, that's where Ice Carver steps in.<\/p>\n\n<p>Memory can be an issue since you lose 1 MU over Grimoire with Logos. The ideal setup should have Djinn hosting Keyhole and a Datasucker, with 3 breakers out. Personal workshop helps greatly here to make sure you install your programs in the right order. You can always Aesop datasuckers and install new ones on top of Djinn if necessary.<\/p>\n\n<p>Finally, the choice of identity is flexible. I chose Whizzard because trashing key assets is really important to slow the game down and give you time to setup your rig. Noise's ability is OK, but this deck doesn't run that many viruses. Reina Roja is decent, but you might not run every turn, especially with Wyldside installed, so you can't use the ability that effectively.<\/p>\n","username":"johncraven","cards":{"01002":1,"01005":3,"01007":2,"01008":3,"01009":2,"01011":2,"01012":3,"01014":2,"01015":1,"01016":3,"01047":1,"01050":3,"01053":3,"02001":1,"02009":2,"02049":1,"03052":3,"04061":1,"04067":3,"04102":3,"05037":3}},{"id":5371,"name":"RP Slow Advance","creation":"2014-05-09 17:46:19","description":"\n","username":"gotsanity","cards":{"01064":2,"01069":2,"01070":3,"01071":2,"01077":2,"01078":2,"01108":3,"01109":3,"01111":3,"02013":2,"02031":1,"02032":3,"02110":2,"04015":2,"04054":3,"04077":2,"04114":2,"05005":3,"05007":3,"05015":3,"05026":2}},{"id":5372,"name":"The Stirling Connection (v1.2)","creation":"2014-05-09 17:49:42","description":"<p>Overall, I felt this deck play more like a Shaper as it requires the player to take time to build his or her rig with \"Connection\" resources.  It may not have the aggressiveness seen in most of the Criminal identity or even with Kate Datasucker and Chaos Theory Event build such as Chaos Thievery introduced by PeekaySK.<\/p>\n\n<p>The key to this deck is to put down as many Connection Resources (there are total of 13 Connection Resources that can be played, minus one additional copy of Kati Jones since it is unique) and then later play Calling in Favors to gain big money.<\/p>\n\n<p>I don't think this deck is of tournament material especially (if the players need to allow the Corp to score agenda first before Stirling's ability get to activate) but I believe it is solid enough for casual play.<\/p>\n\n<p>As with most Runner decks that focus more on building the rig first, The Stirling Connection will have problem dealing with Fast Advance corp decks especially from NBN with its Astrochain.  I personally think when playing against Fast Advance deck is to just forget about Stirling's power can prevent the corp from scoring first.<\/p>\n\n<p>Data Dealer\nI can see the potential of Data Dealer to be useful in Stirling deck if he wants to have a lower agenda score than the Corp but would probably suggest to only use it on the 1 pointer agenda.<\/p>\n\n<p>Even if it is not used, it can help provide an additional credit for Calling in Favour.  Furthermore, Data Dealer does not require any credit to install.<\/p>\n\n<p>Tri-Maf Contact\nI am apprehensive of having more than one copy of this card.  One reason, you can only use it once per turn.  Second reason, with more than 1 copy, the other will most probably become \"dead\" card.  Third reason, I don't like idea of having to thrash Tri-Maf from my grip or to be snipe by the Corp as a result of some damage taken.<\/p>\n\n<p>Fall Guy\nThe use of Fall is mostly to protect Professional Contact and also Kati Jones from being thrashed.  I don't think I would likely to thrash it to gain 2 credit.<\/p>\n\n<p>Compromised Employee and Forged Activation\nI think Forged Activation combo well with Compromise Employee.  I can instead of running forced the Corp to rez its Ice and then gain credit from Compromised Employee.<\/p>\n\n<p>No Emergency Shutdown\nI am still unsure about this.  It can be argued that this may synergise well with Compromised Employee by forcing the Corp to derez its Ice after running the HQ and then rez it again to activate the credit gain ability of Compromised Employee.  At this moment, my apprehension of not putting them in is due to the card limit.  Will have to think later what card I can take out to put Emergency Shutdown in to see how it plays out.<\/p>\n\n<p>Sneakdoor Beta\nI have been mulling the limitations of this deck without Sneakdoor Beta.  Without it, this deck cannot put pressure on three of the Corp's central server.  Also, it may act as a surprise to the Corp player because they may often think that Sneakdoor Beta is mostly played by Gabe.  Also, the Corp is less likely to defend the Archive especially they don't see Datasucker in play.<\/p>\n\n<p>Decoy instead of Plascrete\nI opt to put in Decoy as an answer to Scorched Earth threat instead of using Plascrete Carapace in order to have more connection card in play.<\/p>\n\n<p>No Console\nI am undecided whether to put a console in but if I do, I would most probably have 1 Desperado and not multiple copy.  I need room for my Dyson Mem Chip so it can activate Underworld Contact.<\/p>\n\n<p>I don't really like Logos, the new Criminal console from Honor and Profit.  If Logos came out late, the Corp will already score most of the agenda for the Runner to reap any benefit from Logos.  However, a friend of mine argued that to get Logos out early, put in 3 copy.  True, but in comparison to Desperado, Logos is much more expensive and, in my personal opinion, don't offer much utility value.<\/p>\n\n<p>E3 Feedback\nI put in this card is just to surprise the HB player.  Currently many of them do not expect Runner to pack this in (especially when my friend have Heimdal 1.0, Heimdal 2.0, and Januse as their Ice). But if I need to take out a card to cut down to 45, I would probably remove E3.<\/p>\n\n<p>I hope you all like this deck and will welcome any comment that come with it.  Thanks.<\/p>\n","username":"brightknight_216","cards":{"01007":2,"01020":3,"01021":2,"01022":2,"01026":1,"01028":1,"01031":1,"01032":2,"01049":1,"01050":3,"01051":1,"02007":1,"02009":2,"02024":1,"02025":3,"02028":2,"02069":2,"02091":2,"02104":2,"02107":1,"03049":1,"03054":2,"04004":2,"04106":2,"05028":1,"05031":3,"05050":1}},{"id":5375,"name":"1000 cuts","creation":"2014-05-09 18:46:11","description":"<p>the whole point of this is let them have agendas and just keep hitting them\nmushin the overwriter or junebug if they dont run them then its trick fuel for philotic<\/p>\n","username":"tauntdragoon","cards":{"01067":1,"01069":2,"01070":2,"01072":3,"01077":2,"01110":2,"02012":2,"02032":3,"02033":3,"02080":2,"02095":3,"03009":1,"03023":1,"04012":2,"04015":2,"04032":3,"04039":3,"04073":3,"05004":3,"05006":1,"05011":3,"05015":2,"05020":1}},{"id":5376,"name":"noisy mill 1.0","creation":"2014-05-09 18:52:55","description":"\n","username":"tauntdragoon","cards":{"01001":1,"01002":3,"01003":2,"01005":3,"01006":1,"01007":1,"01008":2,"01009":2,"01010":2,"01011":1,"01012":3,"01014":1,"01026":1,"01034":1,"01050":2,"02003":2,"02004":1,"02022":2,"02028":2,"02041":2,"02081":3,"02086":2,"02091":2,"02102":2,"03035":2,"04005":2,"04082":2}},{"id":5377,"name":"To The Heap!","creation":"2014-05-09 19:51:15","description":"\n","username":"bewnt","cards":{"01062":1,"01067":1,"01070":3,"01077":1,"01101":2,"01110":3,"02032":3,"02060":1,"04012":3,"04013":3,"04015":3,"04020":1,"04032":3,"04033":1,"04058":3,"04093":2,"04100":2,"04114":2,"05004":3,"05005":3,"05006":1,"05016":3,"05017":2}},{"id":5378,"name":"Cryptic","creation":"2014-05-09 19:52:07","description":"\n","username":"tberton","cards":{"01061":1,"01062":2,"01068":3,"01110":3,"02029":3,"02031":1,"02032":3,"04015":3,"04054":3,"04073":3,"04093":3,"04096":3,"04114":2,"04119":3,"05006":1,"05009":3,"05012":1,"05016":2,"05017":2,"05018":2,"05020":1,"05026":1}},{"id":5379,"name":"Cryptic","creation":"2014-05-09 19:53:39","description":"\n","username":"tberton","cards":{"01061":1,"01062":2,"01068":3,"01110":3,"02029":3,"02031":1,"02032":3,"04015":3,"04054":3,"04073":3,"04093":3,"04096":3,"04114":2,"04119":3,"05006":1,"05009":3,"05012":1,"05016":2,"05017":2,"05018":3,"05020":1,"05026":1}},{"id":5380,"name":"HB Kicks Your Door Down v3","creation":"2014-05-09 20:50:19","description":"<p>In the recent changes to this deck, I've dropped the Blue Levels in favour of Archived Memories.

The total now stands at 7, and I'm pretty comfortable with it. <\/p>\n\n<p>Ice up one of HQ\/R&amp;D ASAP, depending on what Runner you face. Hokusai generally still goes on R&amp;D, but can go on a remote with a Fetal in a pinch. You can ice up one remote if needed, for bluffing Fetals\/Ronins. Even a single Tsurugi is a decent deterrent; a Chummed Tsurugi or Viktor 2.0 is pretty solid. <\/p>\n\n<p>Otherwise, play the usual Jinteki shell game. Sticking a single point of brain damage goes a long way, especially in the early game; the deck would love to get the third Cerebral back, but it's hard to give up Sweeps Week, which is an absolute all-star in the Andromeda-heavy tournament scene, and is still often a Hedge Fund against Runners who correctly keep their hands as full as possible. <\/p>\n\n<p>Under consideration for v1.4: a single surprise Archer.

I was experimenting with both Knight and Keyhole in Andy to see which I liked better, and that spread the deck too thin; it went 2-1 at the tourney and I finished second of 16 players. That answered the question: Knight is great in Andy, and great overall, but Keyhole is better. So I reconfigured the deck closer to standard Andromeda, but with Keyholes in place of the usual R&amp;D Interfaces. <\/p>\n\n<p>Using Keyhole and keeping a resilient breaker suite (no more 1x Corroder now that Power Shutdown exists) meant cutting Quality Time. Lawyer Up isn't pure draw, but it's a great way to dig after you land a Siphon. John Masanori also helps you dig, and Lawyer Up conveniently mitigates his tags as well. <\/p>\n\n<p>The Akamatsus are necessary to support Keyhole, even though it means going down to a single Datasucker. Watch out for Power Shutdown with X=1; try to have a sacrificial Faerie available when Akamatsu and\/or Datasucker are in play.

With his identity, he is able to make full use of the many cards that are able to pressure the Corporation. <\/p>\n\n<p>Magnum Opus is the main economy for this deck and one must be wary of his MU as well as 'Destroyer' ICE. With the shortage of MU before The Toolbox comes into play, he needs to be able to decide where he is going to pressure in there early stages. The secondary economy comes from the 'Draw and FCC' combo to discard cards that will be useful in future. Do not count much on this secondary economy as there will be situations where the cards just do not come to you. Be it MO, test runs or FCC, it is preferable that your starting hand consist of at least one of these cards to get the ball rolling. On a side note, Djinn lifts some of the burden away when it hosts MO. Setting up a MO economy may be delayed for one or two turns so be ready to encounter possible rushes to score agendas.<\/p>\n\n<p>Next, The Professor shines with the countless programs in his stack that are able to apply pressure anywhere at anytime. R&amp;D locks with the latest Keyhole and Medium, HQ locks with Sneakdoor Beta and Nerve Agent and just terrorizing key cards of the Corp with Imp and Keyhole. These cards are easily tutored out through SMC, Clone Chips and Test Run to surprise the Corp and grab that match point. In addition, Scavenge is there to convert 'dead ' programs to ones which are useful in the given situation. One simple example is to replace Keyhole into a Sneakdoor Beta when R&amp;D becomes a tight fortress to break in.<\/p>\n\n<p>Besides pressuring the centrals, remotes servers are not spared as well. When there is a need to enter and steal that agenda, Stimhack, Clone Chips and SMC can pull out your answers. Parasite and Wyrm is there for ICE destruction, Faerie is there for tough sentries that go beyond Mimic's strength. Deus X helps with big AP ICE like Heimdall and Janus as well as facing Jinteki's relentess Net DMG. Other than that, the breaker suite would probably consist of the 3 Anarch breakers. Also, Zu is picked over Gordian as it's lower cost and cloud computing would help with the issue of MU.<\/p>\n\n<p>Lastly are the cards left unexplained. LALA is added due to the number of cards you would be throwing into the heap and gives you a health recovery when facing Jinteki. Escher is placed to ease certain servers when you so decide to run in frequently. Plascrete, needless to say is added but only as a one off to prevent dead draws for FCC. Your economy along with Imp should be able to avoid getting SEA Sourced and Scorched.<\/p>\n\n<p>Currently, the problems encountered would be having a dry spell in economy but putting luck aside, match ups that consist ton of DMG onto his grip as well as destroyers are giving trouble to the professor. Look out for Grim as this ICE is a pain to break given the limited killers in this deck. You would not want to constantly pick a Faerie out for your central runs. <\/p>\n\n<p>In overall, The Professor has many tricks up his sleeves which can be pulled out instantaneously. Maybe I am just missing out on its flaws compared to other runners but i feel that he is definitely an underrated Identity that can prove to be a fun one. Enough ranting and I hope that all your comments would increase potential of this deck.

I'm still tweaking it, but the deck is designed to just be agile and quick. That means that against Jinteki you're going to have a pretty rough time. Indexing will help with this, but it probably won't be enough.<\/p>\n\n<p>Interfaces are really important when playing against NBN these days, you almost shouldn't be running centrals with out them; except that you have to or you'll lose. Be warry of grim. Mimic is a really efficient breaker, but grim will ruin your day if you don't have the suckers. (Keep atman &amp; smc in mind if you're expecting that. 4\/5 is a pretty good target for atman in this deck, 5 when against weyland so that archer only needs 1 counter)<\/p>\n\n<p>Bank job is of course just awesome when playing against NBN. Their centrals used to be pretty damn porous, but these days the neutral ice package means you need breakers against every deck and therefor money.<\/p>\n\n<p>You could lose pro-co &amp; plascrete to really speed this beast up in certain ways, possibly turning a bank job into stim hacks. Kati is also a questionable include, but the fact is that you don't always draw testrunopus. Sometimes she fills a gap and sometimes she doesn't. That's another call. Otherwise I don't think there's much you can change unless you don't want to do the parasite thing, which is legitimate. Parasite could be nerve agent or another HQ interface. I think I'd personally take the interface or a legwork since NBN FA is somehow a taxing deck too. (ELI! WHY ARE YOU ONE INFLUENCE!?)<\/p>\n\n<p>So, there are questionable includes, but this is a deck I built last fall for plugged-in tour when I wasn't as focused of a player. I've already made some tweaks to increase its quality, but I'll leave the rest up to the reader. There are so many threats now that I don't know if I could pick the \"right\" card for the deck. You'll notice there's only tutors to guard against will 'o the wisp, maybe you want redundancy on breakers?<\/p>\n\n<p>Anyways, this deck does win against NBN. I just want to share it to maybe take some of the sting off playing against FA.

My inexperience with the deck showed, but I still stumbled to a 3-1 record with it, beating NBN Making News and Near-Earth Hub decks while dropping a game to a Replicating Perfection glacier build.<\/p>\n\n<p>My biggest issue with the deck is consistency.  The centerpieces of the deck are Desperado and Security Testing, and I rarely found either in my opening hand despite aggressively mulliganing for it.  That said, it was a ton of fun to play when it worked, and it was nigh unstoppable once things were clicking.<\/p>\n","username":"CrimsonWraith","cards":{"01002":3,"01005":3,"01007":2,"01008":2,"01009":1,"01010":2,"01011":3,"01012":3,"01014":1,"01015":1,"01024":2,"01050":3,"01053":3,"02001":1,"02003":3,"02009":2,"02041":1,"03052":2,"04043":3,"05033":3,"05048":2}},{"id":8893,"name":"House of Leaves","creation":"2014-08-23 23:31:13","description":"<p>This RP build is designed to be extremely threatening to the Runner and exploit scoring windows to maximum effect.  Nisei Mk.2 and House of Knives combine to provide a snowball effect that allows this deck to carry momentum into the late game.  Subliminal Messaging can be an economic all-star in RP, and the effect is only magnified by the addition of Enhanced Login Protocols and House of Knives (both of which often cause to Runner to hesitate and space their runs across multiple turns).  Medical Research Fundraiser was found to be much more desirable in this build then Celebrity Gift for several reasons:  1.) Information is too valuable, giving away the contents of your hand ruins the use of cards such as Mushin No Shin and your ICE 2.) Clicks are too valuable and perhaps most surprising of all 3.) the Runner's money is a lot less valuable against this build then you'd think.  Mental Health Clinic likewise fell by the wayside when it was found that the drawback of increased runner hand size was a detriment to the click compression and brain damage aspects of this deck and money was never a problem anyway.<\/p>\n\n<p>This realization is also a big part of the fact that Nisei Mk. 2 gets the nod over NAPD Contract.  In this RP build CLICKS, CARDS, and INFORMATION are to be the runner's downfall.  Even against a fully developed late-game rig and endless cash resources this deck has beaten Big Rig Shaper by scoring out agendas the old-fashioned way.  How is this possible?  Simply by controlling the flow of information and providing too intimidating a front to penetrate, an effect that will occur by a combination of scored Nisei\/HoKs, multiple remote servers with facedown cards (Ronins waiting for a critical mistake, most of them), ELP in play, and Bioroids and a host of other taxing ICE clogging up the centrals.  If the runner only knew which scoring server to go they could win, but the trip through centrals costs them an entire turn as well as most of the cards in their hand... with Nisei Mk. 2 as the emergency reset button to ensure they <em>cannot win<\/em> even by making the right choice.<\/p>\n\n<p>Most often by feeding the Runner Fetal AI's and aggressively scoring out House of Knives with the standard remote server shell-game in the early phase you can slow their attack long enough to close the central servers off.  Once this is done, with an Agenda (Nisei Mk. 2 most often) that you are ready to try to score, is the right time to play Enhanced Login Protocols.  Be ready though because the Runner will often immediately attempt to burn their multi-access events in the hope of snagging an agenda from HQ or R&amp;D to shut down ELP.  Punish them with your ICE and make sure the agenda you want to score is not in hand but hidden among your remotes... they almost certainly won't attempt to find it.  Use Mushin No Shin to power out Agendas early on or, if you have nothing else you want to score, Ronins.  A Ronin is a terrible thing to die to but runners seem find ways to do it out of frustration once they see this deck begin to take off.<\/p>\n\n<p>This deck wants to move quickly and get ahead because it loves momentum, it's important to remember that to the runner the most intimidating card in this deck bar none is <em>any face-down one<\/em>.  It could be Project Junebug, Snare, anything but what you actually have (that's why I don't bother with those cards, they do their work on the Runner's psyche just sitting in the binder).<\/p>\n\n<p><em>'Enter the House if you must, but beware the Minotaur.'<\/em><\/p>\n","username":"umbralAeronaut","cards":{"01061":1,"01062":1,"01063":2,"01068":3,"02031":1,"02032":3,"02095":2,"02110":1,"02112":2,"04013":2,"04015":2,"04033":1,"04054":3,"04073":3,"04074":1,"04093":2,"04100":2,"04114":2,"05004":3,"05006":1,"05007":1,"05014":3,"05015":2,"05017":2,"05019":1,"06003":1,"06022":2}}]

There were eight players. Its record was 4-0-1 in five games. Three were won through meat damage. The fourth was won in points. <\/p>\n\n<p>I heard about this \"broken strategy\" on a podcast that didn't sound so good to me so I decided to give it a shot to see if it would work. It's been doing much better than I anticipated. <\/p>\n\n<p>Main Strategy: \nBuilt to trigger a combo whereby you tag the runner and then play 2 or 3 Scorched Earths in one turn. <\/p>\n\n<p>Sample Meat-Kill Methods: \n1) Posted Bounty, Scorched, Scorched\n2) Score ready-to-go Posted Bounty, Power Shutdown whole deck, Jackson Accelerated Diagnostics Scorched Scorched, draw, play Accelerated Diagnostics<\/p>\n\n<p>Note: The following methods require the Runner to have run last turn. <\/p>\n\n<p>3) SEA Source, Scorched, Scorched\n4) Power Shutdown whole deck, Jackson in SEA Source Scorched Scorched, play Accelerated Diagnostics, play third Scorched from hand (if necessary)\n5) Play SEA Source from hand, Power Shutdown whole deck, Jackson in Scorched Scorched Scorched, play Accelerated Diagnostics<\/p>\n\n<p>Considerations: \n1) You often can kill the runner in just two clicks. That third click and an extra Power Shutdown can sometimes be used to get rid of a pesky Carapace or Decoy. \n2) Beware a Noise that can put out Viruses mid-turn and skim the top card off your deck mid-combo. Though, sometimes you can still pull it off (especially if that SEA Source is in hand). \n3) There are very few ICE in this deck, but one big one will slow the runner considerably. If you are playing a Runner that can hop big ICE easily; you will are more likely to lose. However, if you draw like a maniac to get that combo while using spare Jacksons to cycle agendas back through you stand a good chance of winning. \n4) A feasible secondary strategy is to get out a big ICE early and then quickly advance agendas behind it before the runner can get through. The agendas often help buy time for or trigger your combo anyhow, so there's less loss in attempting it. \n5) Don't mess up your math (: <\/p>\n\n<p>Math Shortcut: \nA guaranteed SEA Source will cost the Runner's credits + link (minimum 2). <\/p>\n\n<p>Tournament Info Link:\nhttps:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/1iVDi3BA9oy8kXKXdC0Fs3TLHKcwgYAJTsIZ84F01DhY\/edit?usp=sharing<\/p>\n","username":"quizoid","cards":{"01086":1,"01093":1,"01095":2,"01098":3,"01099":3,"01101":2,"01102":2,"01103":3,"01106":3,"01110":3,"01111":3,"02018":3,"02070":3,"03012":1,"04015":3,"04033":1,"04036":1,"04040":3,"04052":3,"04058":3,"04072":2,"04078":1}},{"id":1749,"name":"Central Control Kate v2","creation":"2014-01-26 22:40:54","description":"<p>Know stuff, control stuff!<\/p>\n\n<p>Keep centrals de-iced or cheap to break with Parasite\/Atman\/Corroder as necessary.<\/p>\n\n<p>Keyhole\/Indexing for smart R&amp;D check-ins.

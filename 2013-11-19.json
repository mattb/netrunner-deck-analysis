If you manage to have The Source and a powered-up Chakana (or more than one), the Corp will be forced to flush the virus tokens. Just do it again, they can't purge them all the time.","username":"paddosan","cards":{"01001":1,"01002":2,"01006":2,"01007":1,"01008":3,"01009":3,"01010":1,"01011":1,"01012":3,"01015":2,"01050":3,"01051":2,"02003":2,"02081":3,"02091":2,"03043":3,"03052":3,"03053":3,"03055":3,"04005":3}},{"id":598,"name":"NBN's Bizarre Adventure v2","creation":"2013-11-19 09:19:29","description":"t's a combo deck with multiple win conditions available. <br>1\\ SanSan : Strangely enough, the deck doesn't use trace ice.

Rince and repeat for every agenda you get. <br><br>2\\ Midseason\/Beale\/Psycho : Bad publicity will be of no use for the runner against trace events and this is why I chose Making News ID. Using money generators (Pop-up, Hedge Fund, GLC, Profiteering), the deck can quickly climb at 15-20 credits, making it possible to score a 4-5 AP Beale for victory. <br><br>3\\ Midseason\/SE\/Archived Memories\/PSF : Alternatively to scoring, SE\/PSF can flatline the runner. Plascrete can nullify partially. If PSF is scored, focus on those and then SE the runner. <br><br>4\\ Program destruction : Useful again noise and criminal. With Grim and Swordsman, the deck can create timing opportunities to score more agendas. <br><br>Additionnal Info : 1 Closed Accounts against tagme runners or after a bad Account Siphon. 1 Swodsman against Atman\/Darwin\/Crypsis. 45 Cards only to maximise probabilities.","username":"NetEldrogo","cards":{"01058":2,"01062":1,"01080":1,"01081":3,"01082":1,"01084":1,"01085":2,"01092":2,"01099":1,"01103":1,"01107":2,"01110":3,"01111":3,"01113":2,"02056":3,"02070":3,"02115":3,"02116":2,"04015":3,"04020":3,"04033":1,"04039":3}},{"id":599,"name":"Shaper - Core Set","creation":"2013-11-19 09:41:02","description":"","username":"szutek","cards":{"01004":2,"01008":3,"01011":2,"01019":3,"01022":2,"01026":1,"01033":1,"01034":3,"01035":3,"01036":3,"01037":2,"01040":2,"01041":3,"01042":2,"01043":2,"01044":2,"01049":3,"01050":3,"01051":1,"01053":3}},{"id":600,"name":"Criminal - Core Set","creation":"2013-11-19 09:42:00","description":"Good deck for new players.","username":"szutek","cards":{"01004":2,"01007":2,"01008":3,"01011":2,"01014":2,"01017":1,"01018":2,"01019":2,"01020":3,"01021":3,"01022":3,"01023":2,"01024":3,"01026":1,"01028":2,"01029":3,"01030":1,"01036":1,"01049":2,"01050":3,"01053":3}},{"id":601,"name":"Weyland - Core Set","creation":"2013-11-19 09:42:31","description":"Good deck for new players.","username":"szutek","cards":{"01065":2,"01070":3,"01086":1,"01092":1,"01093":1,"01094":2,"01095":3,"01097":2,"01098":3,"01099":3,"01101":2,"01102":2,"01103":3,"01104":3,"01106":3,"01107":3,"01108":2,"01109":2,"01110":3,"01111":2,"01112":2,"01113":2}},{"id":602,"name":"Noise - Core Set","creation":"2013-11-19 09:42:47","description":"Good deck for new players.","username":"szutek","cards":{"01001":1,"01002":2,"01004":2,"01005":3,"01006":3,"01007":2,"01008":3,"01009":3,"01010":2,"01011":2,"01012":3,"01014":2,"01016":2,"01019":3,"01022":3,"01044":3,"01049":3,"01050":3,"01051":1}},{"id":603,"name":"Jinteki - Core Set","creation":"2013-11-19 09:43:21","description":"Good deck for new players.","username":"szutek","cards":{"01065":3,"01067":1,"01068":3,"01069":2,"01070":3,"01071":2,"01072":3,"01074":2,"01075":2,"01076":3,"01077":3,"01078":2,"01086":1,"01099":2,"01104":2,"01106":3,"01107":3,"01108":2,"01109":3,"01110":3,"01111":2}},{"id":604,"name":"HB - Core Set","creation":"2013-11-19 09:43:42","description":"Good deck for new players.","username":"szutek","cards":{"01054":1,"01055":3,"01057":2,"01058":1,"01060":1,"01061":3,"01062":3,"01063":3,"01064":3,"01065":3,"01070":3,"01092":1,"01098":3,"01103":2,"01106":3,"01107":3,"01108":2,"01109":3,"01110":3,"01111":2,"01113":2}},{"id":605,"name":"NBN - Core Set","creation":"2013-11-19 09:44:07","description":"Good deck for new players.","username":"szutek","cards":{"01059":2,"01070":2,"01080":1,"01081":3,"01082":3,"01084":1,"01087":2,"01088":3,"01089":2,"01090":3,"01091":2,"01092":3,"01098":3,"01106":2,"01107":3,"01108":2,"01109":3,"01110":3,"01111":3,"01112":1,"01113":3}},{"id":606,"name":"Exile's ICE Destroyer Device","creation":"2013-11-19 10:59:24","description":"Untested yet.<br><br>Focused on destroying ICE after anon asked for more examples of ICE destroying decks.<br><br>Strategies:<br>Test Run\/Scavenge to install the programs.

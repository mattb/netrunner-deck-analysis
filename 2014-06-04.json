[{"id":6390,"name":"Custom Biotics - Trashing the Sentry","creation":"2014-06-04 01:24:12","description":"<p>Decklist I used at my local game shop's league event, Iain Sterling vs. Custom Biotics. It went 2-0, these were the only two times I played the deck. <\/p>\n\n<p>This deck contains mostly sentries. The idea here is that it makes basically every other breaker except Killers a dead draw. Also, I only have to worry about trashing one type of breaker with a piece of ice, power shutdown, corporate troubleshooter, or agsec. Wraparound is there for mid-late game gear check, and hopefully make it so you can sneak out an agenda. In the two games that I played I actually never landed a corporate troubleshooter or a power shutdown. The econ can sometimes be kind of light, since there isn't that much burst, so you have to wait for drip econ like adonis. There are 20 pieces of ice and 3 jacksons so usually you can afford to use accelerated beta test.<\/p>\n\n<p>I'd like to keep testing this deck, because it's kind of fun to play with.<\/p>\n","username":"steevo15","cards":{"01055":3,"01056":3,"01057":2,"01062":2,"01064":3,"01065":2,"01106":3,"01110":3,"02012":2,"02019":3,"02074":1,"02117":1,"02120":3,"03002":1,"04015":3,"04020":3,"04058":3,"04090":2,"04096":2,"04100":2,"05024":3}},{"id":6391,"name":"Kate Atman ","creation":"2014-06-04 02:04:54","description":"\n","username":"trilamb","cards":{"01008":3,"01012":1,"01024":3,"01026":1,"01033":1,"01035":3,"01050":3,"02009":2,"02066":1,"02091":3,"02106":2,"02107":2,"03031":1,"03034":2,"03038":3,"03040":3,"03046":3,"03049":3,"03052":3,"03053":3}},{"id":6392,"name":"Teaching Jinteki: Multi-Core Personal Evolution","creation":"2014-06-04 02:05:45","description":"\n","username":"trilamb","cards":{"01064":2,"01065":2,"01067":1,"01068":3,"01069":2,"01070":3,"01072":2,"01073":2,"01075":3,"01076":3,"01077":3,"01078":2,"01098":3,"01103":2,"01106":3,"01107":3,"01109":3,"01110":3,"01111":3,"01113":2}},{"id":6393,"name":"Teaching Haas-Bioroid: Multi-Core Engineering the Future","creation":"2014-06-04 02:06:07","description":"\n","username":"trilamb","cards":{"01054":1,"01055":3,"01056":3,"01057":1,"01058":3,"01059":3,"01061":2,"01062":3,"01063":2,"01064":3,"01065":2,"01090":2,"01098":3,"01103":3,"01106":3,"01107":3,"01108":3,"01110":3,"01111":2,"01113":2}},{"id":6394,"name":"Teaching NBN: Multi-Core Making News","creation":"2014-06-04 02:06:26","description":"\n","username":"trilamb","cards":{"01064":2,"01080":1,"01081":3,"01082":3,"01084":2,"01085":1,"01086":2,"01087":1,"01088":3,"01089":2,"01090":3,"01092":2,"01098":3,"01099":1,"01103":3,"01106":2,"01107":3,"01108":2,"01109":2,"01110":3,"01111":3,"01113":3}},{"id":6395,"name":"Teaching Weyland: Multi-Core BBW","creation":"2014-06-04 02:06:56","description":"\n","username":"trilamb","cards":{"01064":1,"01070":3,"01086":2,"01088":2,"01093":1,"01094":3,"01095":2,"01098":3,"01099":3,"01101":3,"01102":2,"01103":3,"01104":3,"01106":3,"01107":3,"01108":2,"01109":2,"01110":3,"01111":3,"01113":3}},{"id":6396,"name":"Teaching Shaper: Multi-Core Kate","creation":"2014-06-04 02:07:22","description":"\n","username":"trilamb","cards":{"01004":2,"01007":2,"01024":3,"01033":1,"01034":3,"01035":3,"01036":3,"01037":3,"01039":3,"01040":3,"01043":2,"01044":3,"01046":2,"01047":2,"01049":3,"01050":3,"01051":2,"01053":3}},{"id":6397,"name":"Teaching Anarch: Multi-Core Noise","creation":"2014-06-04 02:07:52","description":"\n","username":"trilamb","cards":{"01001":1,"01002":3,"01005":3,"01006":3,"01007":2,"01008":3,"01009":3,"01010":3,"01011":2,"01012":3,"01014":2,"01015":1,"01016":3,"01021":2,"01022":2,"01047":2,"01050":3,"01051":2,"01053":3}},{"id":6398,"name":"Teaching Criminals: Multi-Core Gabe","creation":"2014-06-04 02:08:08","description":"\n","username":"trilamb","cards":{"01004":2,"01007":1,"01017":1,"01018":3,"01019":3,"01020":3,"01021":3,"01022":3,"01024":3,"01026":1,"01027":1,"01028":3,"01029":3,"01030":2,"01036":3,"01043":1,"01049":2,"01050":3,"01051":2,"01053":3}},{"id":6399,"name":"Non-veggie sandwitch","creation":"2014-06-04 07:52:21","description":"<p>The idea 4 this deck came from a friend, who played a very similar deck, during our regionals.

The idea is to obviously build up enough credits to pull off that combo and install a remote with 3 very taxing pieces of ice after you Mushin No Shin  a Mandatory Upgrades. Keep in mind when you Shipment from MirrorMorph you have to pay 3 credits to install the ice.<\/p>\n\n<p>Biotic Labors are there mainly if you want to Score a Profiteering first, but be careful with scoring Profiteering or rezzing a Fenris if you think they might have Blackmail. If you pull off the combo it is likely game over for them unless they can do a crazy deep dig on R and D or get lucky with a Legwork.<\/p>\n\n<p>If they happen to get in and steal the Mandatory Upgrades. You can always drop a Corporate War in that server if it left them broke. Then Biotic Labor and score it to get your money back. Also real nice to drop it in there right after you score Mandatory Upgrades. If they are at 0 points they may put all their efforts into getting in there instead of running R&amp;D and HQ. I usually let them steal it, then score my 3\/2's out of hand to win. If they don't run it then its an easy score to get more money. <\/p>\n\n<p>If you are playing Noise you want to Mushin the Mandatory Upgrades with no less than 15 cards left or you may end up getting decked. Happened to me. Honestly against Noise it might be best just to score with Biotic and get them back with Reclamation Order. 3 Archived Memories works great to get back your Reclamation Orders so you can grab back your econ cards again and again. I've even used Reclamation Order to grab my 2 Copies of Archived Memories and then grab that same Reclamation Order with those.

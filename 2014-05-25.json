How? I'm so glad you asked.<\/p>\n\n<p>1) RP's printed ability is where this all starts. You know, without exception, that the runner will only have 2 clicks to prep before running on your agenda remote. This can make mental math easier when you're trying to tally up what the runner has or could have access to for breaking in and stealing your stuff. Also, many won't run against Jinteki on their last click. And for good reason! But against this deck, what they've learned elsewhere is only slowing them down.<\/p>\n\n<p>2) Next step is the agenda selection. Every single one of these has a cost to steal (excepting installed TFP's and archived FAI's). Again, this helps with mental math. Look like they can break in but be broke? Put down an NAPDC and giggle. Furthermore, you're very (relatively) safe with 1-2 agendas just sitting in HQ, as Shock! and Shi.Kyu make sniffing around there unpleasant and repeatedly running for sucker tokens downright dangerous.<\/p>\n\n<p>3) Piles of taxing ICE with--just a few strong hard stops--seal the deal. Because the agendas are few and costly, you can afford to allow most central accesses without worry. Eli, Pup, Rainbow, and Datapike (or as I like to call it, Minibooth) just take and take, and they cost you relatively little. Tollbooth fills a middle ground; depending on your opponent and the game state it can serve as a hard stop to score behind, especially early in the game. Careful for Femme and Inside Job though! Even into the late game, very few decks can beat a Tollbooth cheaply, so it's almost never a dead draw. <\/p>\n\n<p>If the game runs long enough--and it's likely to, given the deliberate pace this deck prefers--you'll probably need something meaty to score behind. Enter Hadrian's and Susan. I find the former to consistently surprise runners out of faction, and even mighty Corroder pays a premium to beat it. People are starting to expect the latter, but it's still often good for 2-3 turns of frenzied drawing\/cred clicking, which is exactly what you need. On occasion it can even be used to toss the unwary into a Shi.Kyu-spiced garbage heap.<\/p>\n\n<p>4) Speaking of Shi.Kyu, it's a small but potent part of the mix here. Given the number and value of agendas, forcing a single one on your opponent changes their required minimum agenda count from 3 to 4 unless they can steal 2 TFP's. Handing them 2 is brutal, and if they take all 3 their fate may be sealed. It's not even that big a deal that it doesn't fire from R&amp;D, because from there it goes to archives, where it lurks... waiting... ;)<\/p>\n\n<p>This deck is otherwise light on ambushes; Shock! is an annoyance until it hits archives, where it greatly helps to protect your overdrawn agendas. Snare! is the card I most often consider replacing, but once or twice it has really closed out a game for me. I never expect a flatline, but just having those in there helps deter reckless R&amp;D digging.<\/p>\n\n<p>5) To pay for all this you have the myth, the legend, the monster: Sundew. We all know how good this is in RP, so I won't waste much time. Just remember to put it behind some taxing ICE. Obviously Sundew alone isn't enough, so the MHCs provide even more drip. It's such an uneven value proposition for the runner to trash those that, even when they do, you may get a scoring window out of it despite the income loss. Encryption Protocol makes Sundew, MHC, and Jackson even more costly to deal with; there's no greater feeling than watching a runner carefully gather 3 creds, run a central, then come at a Jackson on their last click, knowing all the while that you have 1 or more unrezzed EP's.<\/p>\n\n<p>Lastly, CG does so much good work here. In other decks I'm reticent to reveal so much, but in this one you can nearly always afford to say, \"Hey, look, some ICE and a Fetal.\"<\/p>\n\n<p>I've been playing and iterating on this a lot lately, both in my local meta (Mountain View\/Cupertino represent!) and on OCTGN and after many refinements I enjoy good success against a variety of decks. The feeling of being so strongly in control is incredible. I even won the game in which I suffered the worst first runner turn of my time playing Netrunner: Siphoned to 0, Sundew trashed, agendas taken from HQ and R&amp;D (4 points) and a Caprice trashed from hand.<\/p>\n\n<p>I would love to hear about other similar decks folks are running, and any suggested changes. On that front, I sometimes think about -1Eli -1 Caprice (who surprisingly does not often cinch games for me) +1 Jackson, +1 Katana.<\/p>\n\n<p>Thanks for reading this far, now tell me how wrong I am!<\/p>\n\n<p>5\/25 Made a few edits to the description for clarity's sake.<\/p>\n","username":"partialcharge","cards":{"01070":2,"01090":2,"01102":1,"02029":3,"02031":1,"02032":3,"02110":3,"03027":2,"04012":3,"04015":2,"04054":3,"04073":3,"04114":3,"04119":3,"05007":3,"05009":3,"05011":3,"05018":3,"05020":1,"05025":3}},{"id":6026,"name":"Babylon Knowledge - Chronos Protocol Reggio Emilia (IT) 1st","creation":"2014-05-25 16:03:52","description":"<p>The deck is undefeated in tournament play.<\/p>\n","username":"aldaris","cards":{"01055":3,"01058":2,"01059":3,"01062":2,"01064":2,"01090":1,"01110":3,"02051":3,"02052":2,"02070":2,"02110":2,"03001":1,"03005":3,"03019":3,"03026":1,"04012":2,"04034":3,"04040":3,"04090":2,"04100":2,"04111":2,"04117":2,"04119":1}},{"id":6027,"name":"Pitch black v1.0 - Chronos Protocol Reggio Emilia (IT) 1st P","creation":"2014-05-25 16:06:15","description":"<p>Zion train is coming our way.<\/p>\n\n<p>this deck went 3-2 in the tournament (24 players).\nit has a very easy concept: full rig in 4\/5 turns and cheap run, no multiacces only your skill.\nit's a very philosophical deck, no way to escape if you lose it's probably your fault.\nfor this deck the worst matchup are nbn FA and archer.<\/p>\n","username":"aldaris","cards":{"01007":3,"01008":2,"01011":2,"01014":2,"01015":2,"01016":3,"01022":2,"01026":1,"01049":2,"01050":3,"02001":1,"02009":2,"02042":2,"02062":1,"02066":2,"02091":1,"02103":2,"03033":2,"03052":3,"04009":2,"04102":3,"04109":3}},{"id":6028,"name":"Psionic Tag Punishment (Scorcha' Killa' V2)","creation":"2014-05-25 16:09:41","description":"<p>Through further testing I found the hunters didn't get much done so I traded them in for Tsurugis.<\/p>\n\n<p>Losing a scorched earth did hurt but I found closed accounts easier to pull off with dcent effect and it combos nicely with MRF econ and can turn the deck into something much more taxing though less deadly<\/p>\n","username":"Trizzy613","cards":{"01070":3,"01072":3,"01075":2,"01077":2,"01084":2,"01099":2,"01110":3,"02014":3,"02015":3,"02080":3,"04015":3,"04074":2,"04093":1,"04114":2,"05002":1,"05005":3,"05006":1,"05007":1,"05010":3,"05013":3,"05014":3,"05017":1}},{"id":6030,"name":"Oracle Andy","creation":"2014-05-25 16:38:57","description":"<p>80% of the deck is events, all non-events can be tutored out of the deck or picked up by deja vu if you miss with oracle<\/p>\n","username":"itsbigfoot","cards":{"01002":2,"01007":1,"01018":3,"01019":3,"01021":3,"01022":3,"01026":1,"01032":1,"01036":3,"01050":3,"01051":1,"02043":3,"02083":1,"02091":1,"03052":3,"04004":3,"05033":3,"05035":3,"05036":1,"05046":1,"05054":3}},{"id":6031,"name":"Lategame Medtech","creation":"2014-05-25 17:09:56","description":"<p>The idea is to start scoring in the lategame.

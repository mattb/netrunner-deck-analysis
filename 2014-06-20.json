Like, we always knew it was good, but the extra draw makes asset economy ridiculous. It means that you'll be throwing out <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02059\">Private Contracts<\/a> willy-nilly even without planning to rez them because there is pretty much no downside to it - free draw, costs the runner a click and money to run and trash, or you can surge up quick if they try to siphon you.<\/p>\n\n<p>Combine that with <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01109\">PAD Campaign<\/a>, <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02055\">Marked Accounts<\/a> and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02056\">Pop-up Window<\/a> on every relevant server and you're quickly up to the 7c needed to Biotic an Astro (or a Beale) from hand - which, as a handy bonus, nets you ANOTHER card from the identity power if you put it in a new server.<\/p>\n\n<p>Throw in the extra influence and you can run 3x <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01059\">Biotic Labor<\/a> and all the ice you need - plus one <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01101\">Archer<\/a> (with <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01082\">Breaking News<\/a> for food), in case the game gets a bit longer than you'd hoped - and you're Set Up for some serious shenanigans.<\/p>\n\n<p>I've been playing this deck on OCTGN and I actually feel gross for doing it. There are so many tricks to score agendas; last game I played, I had a scored <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01081\">AstroScript Pilot Program<\/a>, Breaking News on the board, 14 credits (from that asset economy + pop up windows Everywhere) and Biotic, <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01092\">SanSan City Grid<\/a> and a freshly mandatory'd Astro in hand. Turn went:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Biotic (4c)<\/li>\n<li>Install SanSan on BN, rez (6c)<\/li>\n<li>Advance BN once (1c) = Score BN<\/li>\n<li>Install Astro<\/li>\n<li>Advance Astro once (1c) + Astro token = Score Astro<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>That's 12creds for a three-point swing to take me to game point AND the ability to score the final Astro (or Beale, or whatever) from hand. I recognise that's not an example you'll see a lot (the inevitable answer is 'What if they multi-siphon you' or some Reina shenanigans) but it's a demonstration of how ridiculously hard this deck can swing into action when you get the money to do so.<\/p>\n\n<p>To be clear, I'm absolutely not one of those who believes the game's broken or that Astro needs a nerf or anything. That said, if you don't have answers for shenanigans like this in your deck, you're going to have a bad day. Account Siphon works for the early turns, trashing all my assets also works, as does solid R&amp;D lock. It feels weird to waste a Parasite on a pop-up window, but the extra credit it gives me each time has won me multiple games.  I also love a self-tagging DLR deck to ruin my day because I have no tag punishment. Truthfully, I lose a lot to decks like this, so I figured building one for myself might help me figure out the weaknesses. Investigations Continue.<\/p>\n\n<h2><strong>Thoughts:<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>I could probably chuck the <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01090\">Tollbooths<\/a> because they're expensive and a bit later game than you really want to get, but they've been useful once or twice - I'd consider trading them out for <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04034\">Shipment from SanSan<\/a><\/li>\n<li>I know there's another version of this deck out there somewhere which runs 2x Biotic and 2x <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01099\">Scorch<\/a>, and I respect and fear that thing, but I'm not going for that here<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"\/en\/card\/06003\">Lotus Field<\/a> is great because it stops Parasite, which is IMO one of the best answers to FA NBN. It's expensive to rez, but it forces a Code Gate breaker dig and that's just another few turns for you to goof around in. I sort of love it.<\/li>\n<li>Who actually scores <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04119\">NAPD Contract<\/a> intentionally? Not me, that's for sure.

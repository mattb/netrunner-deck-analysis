[{"id":7858,"name":"Dark Side of the Viruses","creation":"2014-07-24 00:27:26","description":"<p>A degenerate deck that draws lots of cheap viruses, installs them, and then pawns them to recover the clicks you spent on them*. The net result is like clicking for credits, except you ground a card off R&amp;D and dug deeper into your deck in the process. <\/p>\n\n<p>This is a slow deck, but it can still pressure the corp by running every now and then, and late game it can funnel its credit pile into some successful runs past heavy resistance. <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01012\">Parasite<\/a> also eats away at ICE, pressuring the corp into installing and rezzing more ICE or purging virus counters.<\/p>\n\n<p>Start by mulliganing for <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01016\">Wyldside<\/a>. Then try to install viruses and, once you have the pawnshop, start pawning them. <\/p>\n\n<p>Eventually you will draw into <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02102\">Darwin<\/a>. Install it and begin accumulating counters. <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01008\">Datasucker<\/a> can assist so keep it low on the pawning priority list. <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01051\">Crypsis<\/a> will let you get past anything in a pinch. <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01010\">Medium<\/a> puts enormous pressure on R&amp;D late game, and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01012\">Parasite<\/a> plus <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01008\">Datasucker<\/a> can eat away ICE. <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02041\">Nerve Agent<\/a> attacks HQ if it's weak, so that the corp has to defend everything.

With <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01006\">Grimoire<\/a> and\/or <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01047\">Aesop's Pawnshop<\/a>, it even gives you a credit surplus!<\/p>\n\n<p>That <a href=\"\/en\/card\/06114\">Ixodidae<\/a> and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/06014\">Lamprey<\/a> are trashed when the corp purges viruses is irrelevant. You'll rarely have more than 1 installed at a time; the corp will just have denied you 3 credits from the inevitable pawning.<\/p>\n\n<p>Virus purging in general doesn't do much except to <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02102\">Darwin<\/a>, because half your viruses' text is irrelevant until the end game and the other half is irrelevant all the time. Darwin can be quickly recharged with <a href=\"\/en\/card\/06113\">Incubator<\/a>s and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01008\">Datasucker<\/a>s after a purge. <\/p>\n\n<p>*You spent 3 clicks on the installation: 1 click to draw it, 1 to install it, and 1 for the credit for its install cost.

I know a few cards stand out as cards people should try to avoid and I'm willing to hear people out in regards to any of them. Except wyrm. Wyrm is going to stay until I get some more play testing in.\nWyrm, Parasite, Datasuckers: Parasite and datasuckers used to be one of my favorite combos, but I often found myself in this awkward position where my virus tokens would get purged and I would have no means of breaking in. With no means of breaking in I couldn't accumulate datasucker tokens. Without datasucker tokens I couldn't force a parasite kill. And finally without forcing a parasite kill, the corp could go a turn or two without worrying about a break in, then purge on every turn 2 or 3 to prevent me from ever getting in. I understand it can be a little bit expensive but having a wyrm out forces them to purge data tokens significantly more frequently or risk losing it to wyrm. That being said I think its important to note that for every -1 on a piece of ice, that it is two credits less to kill it with wyrm and parasite. I also think it might be more important to note that I have no means of searching for wyrm.

It is pretty consistent and I managed to land first in the swiss rounds and 5th in double elimination. I find it pretty fun and challenging to play<\/p>\n\n<p>It is pretty a straightforward deck to run. Install ice on three centrals (tower defense), install your economy assets (win money game) and create a scoring server, preferably three ice deep, with Ash and even Caprice (it can be really taxing, trust me). If you can create a scoring window by feeding them a NAPD, do it. Use Interns to install Ash or Caprice, nothing else.<\/p>\n\n<p>Cards, and tactics<\/p>\n\n<p>1) Nisei mark II, along with Ash and\/or Caprice is brutal. You can drop advance, do something else and fell relatively secure that the runner won't manage to steal the agenda<\/p>\n\n<p>2) Nothing new on Agendas: The Future Perfect is the Best 5\/3 agenda in the game, fetal and NAPD are taxing, and MKII can save you in a tight spot<\/p>\n\n<p>3) Asset economy is Great(!) in this deck: Clinic, PAD, Sundew are great! Maybe you could even drop 2xSuccesful Demonstration for 2x Marked Accounts. When you have >3 economy assets down, your per round income will probably be 4-5 cred's. This is NOT drip economy. You  force the runner either to run and trash them wasting time from hunting agendas, or leave you money for Psi games and traces.<\/p>\n\n<p>4) Succesful demonstration could probably go (see point 3), although a lot of people bounce on central servers to save money for the remotes.<\/p>\n\n<p>5)ICE. Quandary is an dead cheap ETR ice probably forcing the runner to spend a credit each time or force yog out. Pup is also cheap and taxing 2\/credits each time runner goes through. Inazuma is okay, mainly to put the fear inside some runners unless they install a decoder.  You can drop Himitsu as the outermost piece in a central server and take it back to your hand when you will install something meatier. Swordsman is a meta choice, but saved me against an Atman-Datasucker-Parasite Kate deck. The rest is mainly big taxing Ice meant to wear down the runner either economically or by trashing cards from his grip, making it difficult to run remotes each turn. If you manage a Brain Damage or the occasional flatline, it's just a bonus. I might replace Inazuma with Lotus Field when it comes out as it might create better scoring opportunities. <\/p>\n\n<p>6) It can die pretty fast versus Parasites. Don't be afraid to spend a turn purging viruses, especially if you make money anyway from your economy assets.<\/p>\n\n<p>PS: I managed to create a scoring server with 2 pups, 2 Quandaries, Ash and Caprice. That is 6  credits per run, plus Caprice and minimum 4  more  from Ash. Forget Caprice - if you have installed an NAPD, that is a minimum of 14 credits for the runner to steal an agendas in a server you have spent 3 credits to build and 6 to rez cards.<\/p>\n\n<p>Any kind of criticism and productive thought is really appreciated and sought for.<\/p>\n","username":"Greek Geek","cards":{"01061":3,"01068":2,"01109":2,"01110":3,"02013":2,"02031":1,"02032":2,"03014":2,"04013":3,"04015":3,"04033":2,"04054":3,"04060":1,"04074":2,"04114":2,"04119":3,"04120":2,"05007":2,"05009":3,"05016":2,"05017":2,"05018":3}},{"id":7884,"name":"Off the Grid behind two skyscrapers \/ Chronos protocol deck","creation":"2014-07-24 16:53:19","description":"<p>A bit outdated Kind of Red coats Deck.

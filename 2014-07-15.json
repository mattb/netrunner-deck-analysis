But I usually let it sit on <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02049\">Personal Workshop<\/a> so that I can bring it out if it makes sense to femme something or if I need the <a href=\"\/en\/card\/03048\">Inti<\/a> for a wraparound.  The recurring credits can be used for lowering ice strength.  Finally, it's nice to have something big on <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02049\">Personal Workshop<\/a> so that you can put a <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01012\">Parasite<\/a> on it and control exactly when it comes out (and have something to do with unused stimhack credits when the corp doesn't rez anything).<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"\/en\/card\/03040\">Atman<\/a> was a last minute addition I made in case  I ever ran out of <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01012\">Parasite<\/a>s.  A player at the tournament (who ran <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01012\">Parasite<\/a> recursion <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01033\">Kate<\/a> suggested <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01051\">Crypsis<\/a> for breaking ice once in order to rely less on instant <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01012\">Parasite<\/a> installs.<\/p>\n\n<p>It's important to keep drawing while using this deck.  One SMC, a parasite on personal workshop, and a clone chip means you can kill all the ice on a 3-deep server.  After this, you need to be able to get set up again faster than the Corp can draw new ice.  It helps that some ice becomes meaningless.  Two of my opponents rezzed inazumas, which have no effect on this deck.  And a 2-deep server with chum means you spend a couple extra credits and 2 net damage to make the chum useless (and if it's a 0-strength ice, then you can kill it after it's rezzed but before encountering it and chum has no effect).  I never had to use <a href=\"\/en\/card\/03035\">Levy AR Lab Access<\/a>, but it should ensure you can keep up the pressure after the clone chips are gone.<\/p>\n\n<p>As for changes, I will probably switch to <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02106\">Indexing<\/a> instead of <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02107\">R&amp;D Interface<\/a>.  It's possible that this deck is strictly worse than other parasite recursion decks out there, but it's definitely a blast to play... even if just to see the look on their faces when you whip out the Wyrm!<\/p>\n","username":"rnark","cards":{"01004":3,"01008":1,"01012":3,"01013":1,"01026":1,"01034":3,"01040":3,"01041":1,"01044":3,"01050":3,"02009":2,"02041":1,"02046":1,"02047":2,"02049":3,"02107":3,"03035":1,"03038":3,"03040":1,"03046":3,"03048":1}},{"id":7641,"name":"Inside Kate's Mind","creation":"2014-07-15 18:54:36","description":"\n","username":"alientoyshop","cards":{"01004":3,"01033":1,"01034":3,"01038":3,"01047":1,"01050":3,"02009":2,"02024":1,"02028":3,"02047":2,"02068":3,"02088":3,"02091":2,"02107":3,"03037":2,"03048":1,"03053":3,"04004":2,"05037":3,"05053":2}},{"id":7642,"name":"Faction Challenge: Gabe Central Punishment","creation":"2014-07-15 20:27:47","description":"<p>This is part of the Faction Challenge deck series, in which I attempt to create a deck for every faction using only two core sets and one of each data pack and big box expansion.<\/p>\n\n<p>The idea here is to run hard, focusing on central servers, using the new central Icebreakers from H&amp;P.<\/p>\n","username":"LegoMyth","cards":{"01017":1,"01018":3,"01019":3,"01021":2,"01022":3,"01024":2,"01028":3,"01032":2,"01044":2,"02025":3,"02043":3,"02085":3,"02107":2,"03053":3,"04063":2,"05035":3,"05041":2,"05042":2,"05046":2}},{"id":7643,"name":"Decimator Web","creation":"2014-07-15 20:46:26","description":"<p>Ghostly streams of data criss-cross the net in unending complexity like malevolent spider webs underneath the sanctioned data streams.

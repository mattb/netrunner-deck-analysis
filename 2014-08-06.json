If things go well, you'll be able to run every turn without trouble. If things go horribly wrong, you'll die screaming be glad you invested in a deck that's relatively able to bounce back.<\/p>\n\n<p>When you run, you need protection. Speed alone won't take you through Ice. Mimic covers you from most destroyers even without datasucker, so it's the breaker you're most likely to see... tied, that is, with Knight, which rushes lazily onto problem Ice and crushes it -- particularly the popular Quandary. Corroder handles most things well, particularly Wraparound, so it, too, makes a good showing. Yog trails behind, serving to turn expensive servers requiring Knight into free runs, if you need. It's there for back-up more than anything else. Most important about these Icebreakers is their efficiency -- they're relatively easy to get out, in position, and use to exploit openings. They're all among the most cost-effective icebreakers, meaning that the money you make from running helps keep you going.<\/p>\n\n<p>That's right, running makes you money now! Your book of spells has been tossed aside (let's be honest, you're not a proper <em>Wizard<\/em> anyway) in favour of a handsome rogue and a part-time job. Desperado and Security Testing let you exploit your cheap runs, build up money, and keep on running. It makes unprotected assets even <em>more<\/em> of a mistake against Whizzard than usual -- huzzah!<\/p>\n\n<p>The economy is driven by those two splashes, but there's a lot of help for it. Armitage is great for building back up (who wouldn't want to rent a Magnum Opus for a few days at a fifth the sticker price?), Dirty Laundry turns a little more than enough to run into a serious windfall, and Sure Gamble is, as always, a great opener. Cyberfeeder makes your viruses cheaper, but also makes runs easier -- it's a great way to turn \"annoyingly expensive\" into \"somewhat profitable\".<\/p>\n\n<p>What are you doing with all this money? Well, accessing. Everything else is built to assist that, or make your accesses more powerful. Medium and Nerve Agent punish lack of protection (and, delightfully, work <em>very<\/em> nicely in conjunction with Security Testing), Datasucker and Parasite make getting in easier (don't be ashamed to use Parasite as a makeshift datasucker if you must!), and Imp is Imp. Less good for saving you money -- but that really means that your ID ability saves you Imp tokens for the important, otherwise-untrashable things. Just because you're fleeing into danger doesn't mean you have to face your fears, after all.<\/p>\n\n<p>Deja Vu, as always, is great for pulling back either essentials that have been lost forever, or (more often) grabbing \"another\" Imp and Parasite. Express Delivery delivers the card you most need -- or makes the odds of drawing it much higher by triggering a reshuffle. Sure, you sometimes see more than you can take, but it's better than spending <em>more<\/em> money to overdraw and have to discard with Quality Time.<\/p>\n\n<p>Much like the deck's namesake, there's not a lot of memory for spells so it's important to not be too attached to anything. Medium sitting there with a few virus tokens and you without a way in anymore? Lose it for the Datasucker you need to be able to get back in, or the Parasite, or the Knight. I'd hesitate to trash Mimic, Corroder, or Yog -- certainly if you don't have another ready to go.<\/p>\n\n<p>The worst situation to be, with this deck, is against a glacier build (particularly and assetless one) that's able to put itself together despite Imp and Parasite, without datasucker counters. It's not impossible to handle (if they've left any openings at all, which is usual) but it's something to watch for, and you should never be afraid to Imp good Ice away to prevent it.<\/p>\n\n<p>Whizzard is a local meta choice -- I'm sure Reina could pull off something similar, but honestly I don't think it'd be as good. Whizzard's ability might not trigger as often against some decks, but more money that you're not actually spending is nice, and among local players NEH, RP, and Red Coats are all fairly prominent things to deal with right now. Even if not, hey, you're not spending real money to get rid of Caprice, Ash, or Jackson! That's always something.<\/p>\n\n<p>Most importantly: Remember, at all times, to keep running. Don't break yourself doing it, but if you can run somewhere once or twice a turn to make a profit (and see some cards, perhaps), do it.<\/p>\n\n<p>(There are, obviously, a few variations on the theme that you can make. The centerpiece of the deck is using Desperado and Security Testing to increase pressure across the board as a non-Noise Anarch. It'd be more than possible to drop a couple of things for Djinn again, or swap the Express Delivery for Quality Times. This is just the version that's been working best for me, so far.)<\/p>\n","username":"GreatGreedyGuts","cards":{"01002":3,"01005":3,"01007":2,"01008":3,"01010":2,"01011":3,"01012":3,"01014":1,"01024":2,"01050":3,"01053":3,"02001":1,"02003":3,"02009":2,"02041":1,"03052":3,"04043":3,"05033":3,"05048":2}},{"id":8314,"name":"CT's Toybox iii","creation":"2014-08-06 13:27:34","description":"<p>This deck is fun to play, and so far wins more than half the time barring mistakes.<\/p>\n\n<p>There's no server I can't get into with MO + SMC + Clone Chip, and that's really the secret to this deck.

With Deus X and Sharpshooter in your stack (or heap with clone chip) there is no ice that can hurt you, and if you're worried about traps just jack out after you force the corp to access. Once MO is out, Sharpshooter allows you to be incredibly aggressive while you wait for them to make you get a rig. By this time you've scored 1-4 points and trashed some of their economy.

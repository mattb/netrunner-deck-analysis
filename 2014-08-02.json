Also contains a fair bit of versatility in run events in case of metashifts.<\/p>\n\n<p>Features: <\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>45-card deck: The original build for this was a 40-42 card deck sans Knight, and stripping back some run events with a <a href=\"\/en\/card\/05036\">Planned Assault<\/a> for those desperate searches. After a few playtests I've found that Same Old Thing offers a better effect (multiple uses of any event as per situation) and synergises well with the heavy deck drawing to get to my breakers. In my opinion the decreased reliability in draw is outweighed by having those few extra cards for emergencies and replay power.<\/li>\n<li>Central-server run-power: <a href=\"\/en\/card\/05041\">Alias<\/a>\/<a href=\"\/en\/card\/05042\">Breach<\/a>\/<a href=\"\/en\/card\/05046\">Passport<\/a> offer extremely cheap access into all of the central servers, pressuring the corp to invest into heavy ICE protection for these. With this deck, this usually means that the first agenda scoring event by the corp is protected by a single Barrier ICE, which is very easy to blindside with <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01021\">Inside Job<\/a>. Adding in <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04061\">Keyhole<\/a> and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/05035\">Legwork<\/a> offers the pressure probing you need to get the Corp to feel the heat, with the former also offerring some protection against rude-dude-Jinteki trap decks.<\/li>\n<li>Remote Server exposing + indirect accessing: <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01021\">Inside Job<\/a>, as mentioned above, is the early game tool for accessing agenda attempts. I have yet to run into a corp player that, after seeing my central-only breakers and\/or keyhole, has protected their first agenda with more than a single piece of ice. Once you swipe that first agenda though, it becomes necessarity to be able to threaten <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04081\">Quest Completed<\/a> at any given moment. <a href=\"\/en\/card\/05030\">Silhouette: Stealth Operative<\/a>'s innate means that the first run on HQ can show you the red or green light on whether to commit to the Quest run, so it's important to use <a href=\"\/en\/card\/05034\">Feint<\/a> whenever the Corp installs something into their most protected remote.<\/li>\n<li>Run-economy: <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02064\">Doppelg\u00e4nger<\/a>, <a href=\"\/en\/card\/05048\">Security Testing<\/a> and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04009\">John Masanori<\/a> do great work together, as long as you make the runs successful (which, given you will be running a lot on the same servers you should rarely be surprised by tough ICE). <\/li>\n<li>Damage protection: <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04061\">Keyhole<\/a> and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/03035\">Levy AR Lab Access<\/a> for Jinteki net damage rudeness, and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01030\">Crash Space<\/a> to stamp out Weyland meat damage attempts. Unfortunately no brain damage prevention, but as long as you run smart (i.e. first click) HB Ice can be exposed safely without much surprise brain damage.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Strengths:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Punishes unprepared agenda attempts<\/li>\n<li>Destroys trap decks<\/li>\n<li>Does well against multiple remote-server decks (thin ICE on centrals is great)<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"\/en\/card\/04061\">Keyhole<\/a> is nice against Jinteki<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Weaknesses:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>NBN Fast Advance: in theory, this is a horrible match up. This deck needs to hover around 10 credits to be threatening, and needing to trash SanSan Grids or eating Closed Accounts to the face forces you to spend two turns at least recovering, meaning two turns without exposing cards, getting money with Security Testing or getting card draw with John Masanori. In practice, stealing out the first Astroscript sees the Corp to hold his Exodia combo in his hand, ripe for a Legwork. Still, a bad match-up in my opinion.<\/li>\n<li>Glacier ICE decks: usually HB decks, so the best way I have found to attack these is to just run first click to try and expose as much ICE as possible and keep the Corp poor. Unfortunately if you let the Corp build a 4 ICE unrezzed central server you're going to have a bad time. Would like some help with this matchup if anyone has any ideas - I have little clue how to attack it.<\/li>\n<li>Installed Card Destruction: Power Shutdown does heinous things to me, and because you're running so often it's always a threat. The worst thing is, short of Levy you have little way of combatting the threat.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Questionable Deck Additions:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"\/en\/card\/01030\">Crash Space<\/a>: I prefer Crash Space over Plastic Carapace in this instance. It's cheaper, gives you recurring creds to expel any tags incurred, and it still saves you from a double Scorched assuming you end your turn with 5 cards in hand (or, if you manage to have two Crash Spaces out, it revokes the danger of death from double Scorched).<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"\/en\/card\/04084\">Executive Wiretaps<\/a>: This card annoys me being in the deck, however when I took it out the only thing I wanted was to know whether or not to <a href=\"\/en\/card\/05035\">Legwork<\/a>. So reluctantly I placed it back in the deck, but just one copy to get me out of dodge. Still have yet to use it in a game - test or tournament.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"\/en\/card\/04043\">Knight<\/a>: it offers some insurance against not having all of my breakers out, as well as pressuring the corp into having two pieces of ICE to protect vital servers. However I'm constantly tossing up between Knight and Cypsis - the AI breaker rarely sees any action in most of my games period, but it's an insurance that has saved me a couple of times.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"\/en\/card\/01053\">Armitage Codebusting<\/a>: Given my usage of Armitage I feel like it could be swapped with something that doesn't require 7 clicks to install + farm. Something like a <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02091\">Kati Jones<\/a> or another operation. I don't enjoy the risk with Kati in this deck though, with possible tags from John and the constant threat of Sea Source.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"\/en\/card\/04029\">Prepaid VoicePAD<\/a>: A card that is nice to have when you get it early game, but near useless end game. I feel like I could swap it for some regular economy but so far have landed at least one pretty early on in the game, making this event-laden deck just that little bit sweeter.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Feedback encouraged.<\/p>\n","username":"mtblocks","cards":{"01021":2,"01022":2,"01030":2,"01050":3,"01053":2,"02026":3,"02064":2,"03052":2,"03053":2,"03054":3,"04009":2,"04029":2,"04043":1,"04061":2,"04081":2,"05030":1,"05034":3,"05035":2,"05041":2,"05042":2,"05046":2,"05048":2}},{"id":8198,"name":"Near-Money Hub","creation":"2014-08-02 09:41:26","description":"<p>The idea is to get some huge cash flow with lots of asset econ combo's with Diversified &amp; Sweeps Week to make some cash for bigger ice like Flare &amp; Tollboth, Whilst focusing on a fast advance style deck.<\/p>\n","username":"Pinkwarrior","cards":{"01058":1,"01081":3,"01084":1,"01088":1,"01090":3,"01092":2,"01103":3,"01109":3,"02017":2,"02020":2,"02033":2,"02055":3,"02115":3,"02117":2,"03023":2,"04015":3,"04076":3,"04119":3,"05009":3,"05026":3,"06005":1,"06012":1}},{"id":8199,"name":"Economy3 Feedback","creation":"2014-08-02 09:49:23","description":"<p>Premise: a high economy deck that also runs for cheap.<\/p>\n\n<p>Features:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"\/en\/card\/02024\">e3 Feedback Implants<\/a>: with <a href=\"\/en\/card\/05045\">Grappling Hook<\/a>, any ice becomes immediately broken for 1 credit.

I have slowly evolved the deck, making the most drastic revisions with the release of Upstalk.  I played this the other night at a game night event, not losing a game with this or my Gabe list.<\/p>\n\n<p>The deck wins in two basic ways: <\/p>\n\n<p>1.) It kills runners.  You have Snare for the reckless runners. And you have Punitive in tandem with Archived Mems and your 7 3 point agendas. Combine these with Fenris, Janus, and sometimes even Ichi 1.0, and a flatline is easier than you would think.<\/p>\n\n<p>Snare, Punitive, and the low agenda count mean you can often leave your R&amp;D weakly protected.

Just a waste of money, you never kill them with it--it often just makes for Punitive overkill.<\/p>\n\n<p>2.) It scores out agendas. Domestic Sleepers is a godsend for this deck. The runner will have to find 3 of your 7 3\/5 agendas to win (unless playing shenanigans like Notoriety), which is not an easy feat with a 49 card deck.<\/p>\n\n<p>OTHER FEATURES: <\/p>\n\n<p>a.) The deck has a very stable econ with 10 straight econ operations. Of course the ID's ability is helpful as well.  I was playing 2 Efficiency Research at one, but namely bc Blackmail lock was a contender in my meta--this choice helped me to win said Store Champs.  HOWEVER, with only 4 big bioroids, I feel going to 1 is fine--I would prob replace this, as I am not a fan of 1 ofs that do not function as redundancies--I suppose it could be considered Priority Req #4.  The deck can generate the credits to hard rez these beasts if needed--don't forget that you have Priority Req as well.  The deck has great throughput with Blue and Green Level digging you deeper, making the Punitive kill a reality.  The single Celebrity Gift has been incredible, and in truth I would gladly play a second over a Blue Level if I had the influence--but I don't!<\/p>\n\n<p>b.) I am trying the NEXT ice approach for the early ETR and mid to late game credit taxing. Originally, I played Quandary and Enigma, but I think there is something to this update--esp. with Mother Goddess, which also can become a bioroid for Project Wotan, if needed--and is a nice obstacle when she is the only ICE rezzed.  Also, Ichi has proven to be helpful on the ambush to keep the NEXT ice relevant.  Either way, this deck has a lot of ETR.<\/p>\n\n<p>c.) Your agendas actually do things in this deck. You would not believe how often Project Wotan will surprise a run with a short attention span (this is why you need Eli!!!). Scoring one of these often means scoring another 3 pointer in short order.  Priority Req is effectively an econ card, esp. with big bioroids in the deck.  Exec Retreat is great means to get Snares back in your deck, as well as to draw en masse to hit your Punitive combo.<\/p>\n\n<p>d.) On the topic of Punitive, you want to find your way to 2 Punitives or 1 Punitive and an Archived Mems.  Let them steal a 3 pointer: Boom!  Just make sure you have money up.  Remember, after they score that second 3 pointer, these do nothing (unless played immediately after).  It's a bit weird that this can work out this way, but with all the draw, you can just ditch them.  If they play Plascrete, just switch into scoring mode.  Punitive is an opportunity strike: do it when you can--which will be more often than you would assume.<\/p>\n\n<p>Hope this helps!<\/p>\n","username":"travisrchance","cards":{"01054":1,"01058":2,"01062":2,"01070":3,"01106":3,"01110":3,"02012":2,"02039":1,"02070":3,"02110":3,"03006":3,"03013":1,"03015":1,"04011":3,"04012":1,"04030":1,"04071":3,"04079":3,"04090":3,"06001":3,"06002":3,"06010":2}},{"id":8202,"name":"1.5.3.1.1 AGaF Nasir Meidan Basic Idea","creation":"2014-08-02 12:36:30","description":"<p>This is a deck I built to play around with an identity that I truly have not been able to wrap my head around.

This deck will be updated once the Lunar cycle is completed.<\/p>\n\n<p>As an alternative to db0\u2018s brilliant Street Kasparov or the many Overmind\/Dog Pack Exile decks, the approach here is to have a toolbox of programs that is mainly accessed by <a href=\"\/en\/card\/03046\">Self-modifying Code<\/a>s or <a href=\"\/en\/card\/03038\">Clone Chip<\/a>s and boosted by <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04066\">LLDS Processor<\/a>s.<\/p>\n\n<p>The main design goal apart from flexibility is to create significant server accesses out of nothing, thanks to cheap programms and sudden credit bursts from <a href=\"\/en\/card\/03033\">Freelance Coding Contract<\/a>s.<\/p>\n\n<p>In the early game, those bursts will ideally go towards setup turns to mass deploy your <a href=\"\/en\/card\/03038\">Clone Chip<\/a>s and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04066\">LLDS Processor<\/a>s via <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02088\">Replicator<\/a>. Later on, they will go towards installing <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01041\">The Toolbox<\/a> or towards a run, hopefully a decisive one - single copies of <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02106\">Indexing<\/a> and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01036\">The Maker's Eye<\/a> for R&amp;D, <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02041\">Nerve Agent<\/a> for HQ and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02003\">Imp<\/a> for both.<\/p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02065\">Crescentus<\/a> allows you to make all runs costly for the corp, even those that do not net you agendas. The general approach towards ice is to constantly break small speedbumps with cheap breakers and to overcome the big guns just once and then derez them. With just a bit of money and a <a href=\"\/en\/card\/03038\">Clone Chip<\/a> and SMC in play, there is not a lot that you can't break.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"\/en\/card\/04022\">Scheherazade<\/a> and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/03047\">Sahasrara<\/a> will get you through a lot of installs on the cheap, especially since your highest program cost is a measly four creds.<\/p>\n\n<p>That's the plan, and here are the reasons why it usually won't work, a.k.a. things you should be careful of:<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Economy is unreliable, and if your <a href=\"\/en\/card\/03033\">Freelance Coding Contract<\/a>s hide in the bottom of the deck, you will be horribly slow<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 There is not enough recursion to pose a credibly threat for more than a few runs, so losing your <a href=\"\/en\/card\/03035\">Levy AR Lab Access<\/a>es is usually lethal. Don't hold on too long to them, especially if you've alread played more than one <a href=\"\/en\/card\/03033\">Freelance Coding Contract<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>In spite of its problems, this is a very fun deck to play, and can catch corp players on the wrong foot due to being so unusual. <\/p>\n\n<p>The update for Lunar cycle will, of course, include <a href=\"\/en\/card\/06099\">Cerberus \"Lady\" H1<\/a> as a natural fit, and go from event-based draw to <a href=\"\/en\/card\/06079\">Astrolabe<\/a> and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/06116\">Collective Consciousness<\/a>. <a href=\"\/en\/card\/06019\">Leprechaun<\/a> will also allow a replacement of <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04022\">Scheherazade<\/a> with good old <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01044\">Magnum Opus<\/a>, which frees up some influence for new program tools.

Then, you play a Panic Button, and when the runner runs on HQ, you let them in and use Panic Button to draw your deck minus 1 to draw on your next turn. From there, you have so many options, but essentially, you can use a Jackson -> AD chain to Scorch out the runner using Reuse to essentially double your money and using Biotic Labor to get the clicks you need. There are ways to recur Scorch upwards of 5-7 times which is waaay more than enough.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now, as far as comments of resiliency go, this has the advantage over the usual Power Shutdown combos as you can choose what you're discarding. This is a boon against Hades Shard, allowing you to win though it. You also don't necessarily need to draw the whole deck, too. Reuse -> Biotic x2 -> SEA  Source -> Scorch x2 can very easily be lethal, so that lets you win through Noise or Eden Shard. Additionally, there's a Foxfire in the deck to let you force your way through Shards. Also, while it is expensive, using Biotics to score out a Hades Shard negates losing to Noise with a Clone Chip. Finally, there's just so many ways to go off that it's just fun.<\/p>\n\n<p>Currently, the deck is untested, so, we'll see how much money I'll actually have to work with, but I was also looking at a variant without Scorch where you followed up SEA Source with Big Brother and then recurred Traffic Accident over and over. We'll see if it's worth it, as it would give influence for Bullfrog (or more seriously, Power Shutdown). That leads us to the deck's main weak point, which is that if the runner doesn't run HQ, you can never use Panic Button. However, the super low agenda density allows you practical impunity to them getting into R&amp;D fairly often and gives you lots of time to set up something. The deck might need to be less all-in and play 2 point agendas with the intent to score them out, so we'll see what it needs. For now, though, it'll be a fun concept.<\/p>\n","username":"structuremole","cards":{"01059":3,"01064":2,"01086":1,"01099":2,"01106":3,"01110":3,"02070":3,"02100":1,"02110":2,"03006":3,"04015":3,"04040":3,"04052":3,"04059":2,"04060":1,"04072":3,"04090":3,"04100":1,"04111":1,"04120":2,"06021":1,"06041":2,"06070":1,"06071":1}},{"id":10121,"name":"Watching and Waiting","creation":"2014-10-24 12:23:06","description":"<p>(I've not much of a clue how to make the most of Iain, any tips?)<\/p>\n","username":"paulxthompson","cards":{"01021":3,"01022":2,"01028":2,"01050":3,"02009":2,"02024":3,"02028":3,"02045":3,"02066":2,"02069":3,"02085":3,"02088":3,"02091":1,"03049":1,"04004":2,"05028":1,"05037":2,"05050":1,"05052":3,"05053":3}},{"id":10122,"name":"The Fisher King v1.4","creation":"2014-10-24 13:36:59","description":"<p>I've been tweaking this Next+Grail <strong>The Foundry<\/strong> deck lately, and it has given me some satisfactions.

Or an unknown one, since each Grail can be very dangerous.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"\/en\/card\/03023\">Gila Hands Arcology<\/a> proves itself much more useful than <a href=\"\/en\/card\/06081\">Bifrost Array<\/a>, since one gives a fundamental economic boost, and the other just some possible lucky outcome by cloning <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01055\">ABT<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"\/en\/card\/06071\">Hades Fragment<\/a> is a very good Agenda to score against Noise, since it almost makes you immune to loss by empty deck. It can be obviously useful against anyone else, especially to recycle those nice <a href=\"\/en\/card\/06032\">Will-o'-the-Wisp<\/a>s... but it might need <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04015\">Jackson Howard<\/a> to reshuffle otherwise it'll take a long time to draw something back.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"\/en\/card\/06110\">Utopia Fragment<\/a> is possibly the strongest 5\/3 Agenda ever created by FFG. It simply makes any Agenda into a <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04119\">NAPD<\/a>, you just have to install and advance twice. Now the runner knows he'll need 4 more credits to steal it... <strong>if<\/strong> it's an Agenda that card you installed.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>As I mentioned, the deck works better in the long run, since <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04011\">Bronze<\/a> and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/06002\">Silver<\/a> get stronger towards mid or late game, and <em>Grail-type<\/em> ice usually has 3 subroutines, which makes for expensive breaking even with its low strength.\nSo you should <em>wear the runner out<\/em>, score a few points, and slowly advance towards victory.<\/p>\n\n<p>To help with that, there are 4 traps and the nasty <a href=\"\/en\/card\/06032\">Will-o'-the-Wisp<\/a>, which you should <strong>always<\/strong> install together with each Agenda you want to score. That way, even if it's stolen, you get something in return: a time window in which to score another Agenda.<\/p>\n\n<p>The two traps serve two different purposes:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"\/en\/card\/06066\">Reversed Accounts<\/a> is there to show the runner you can actively damage him even if he doesn't run.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"\/en\/card\/01057\">Aggressive Secretary<\/a> comes next, after he find out that you can make him lose his precious money. He still doesn't know you can also <em>disarm<\/em> him.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Economy is provided by <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02070\">Green Level Clearance<\/a> and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01110\">Hedge Fund<\/a> plus <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02092\">Eve Campaign<\/a>, which I chose due to the higher <em>trash cost<\/em>. The runner won't trash it so often as it would an <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01056\">Adonis<\/a>, not with all that ice with 3 subroutines to break.<\/p>\n\n<p>Besides NEXTs and Grails (and their <a href=\"\/en\/card\/06010\">momma<\/a>) there are two more important pieces of ice:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"\/en\/card\/03017\">Ichi 2.0<\/a> is intended as a <em>one-time<\/em> surprise for the runner: it's fairly expensive to break and can be devastating if he's not prepared (also, the Trace 3 is possibly the best Trace there is:Tag &amp; Brain Damage).<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"\/en\/card\/06003\">Lotus Field<\/a> because I preferred to add this one to counter the natural fraily of <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04011\">NEXT Bronze<\/a> against <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01014\">Yog<\/a>, rather than having the third copy of <a href=\"\/en\/card\/06066\">Reversed Accounts<\/a>. It saved me plenty of times already.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>One last suggestion: do not install <a href=\"\/en\/card\/06091\">Merlin<\/a>, it's expensive and most of the times you can't afford to rez it without consequences. Just keep it in your HQ and use it to boost the other, less expensive Grail.<\/p>\n\n<p>Following the same line of reasoning, always keep one <a href=\"\/en\/card\/06051\">Lancelot<\/a> in HQ as well.

I've flat-lined a couple of times (stupid surprise Snare's in HB), but I still love doing it.<\/p>\n","username":"HipsterWannabe","cards":{"01007":1,"01034":3,"01037":3,"01044":3,"01050":3,"02068":3,"02088":3,"02107":3,"03028":1,"03035":1,"03041":3,"03042":2,"03046":3,"03054":1,"04006":3,"04086":2,"04104":2,"06040":3,"06055":2,"06057":3}},{"id":10132,"name":"Kate Durdle-y Shennanigans ","creation":"2014-10-24 17:52:31","description":"<p>I\"m new to Netrunner and this is my first runner deck.

But it could work... maybe bring it to a monthly store champs...<\/p>\n\n<p>One of the more obscure options that was available to PS\/AD combo decks was the posted bounty kill -- that is, using the combo both to score posted bounty, landing a tag without a trace, and to gain enough clicks to play up to all 3 scorches. But the problem with this plan was that you simultaneously needed to build a giant credit pool while also spending money on ICE to defend and rush agendas. With Blue Sun, your ICE and your credit pool are the same, so I wonder if the posted bounty combo kill might have some teeth again.<\/p>\n\n<p>The combo for 12 meat damage is as follows:<\/p>\n\n<p>Click 1: Power shutdown ($27 left).<\/p>\n\n<p>Click 2: Install JH<\/p>\n\n<p>Pile #1 -- JH for: interns, reclamation order, biotic labor<\/p>\n\n<p>Click 3: Accelerated diagnostics ($26 left).<\/p>\n\n<p>Interns installs JH #2.

Biotic labor; 4 clcks and $10 left.<\/p>\n\n<p>Click 6: Advance and score PB ($9 left).<\/p>\n\n<p>Clicks 7-9: Scorched earth ($0 left)<\/p>\n\n<p>If you only need 2 scorched earths, replace one of the biotic labors with subliminal messaging, which needs $20 to start with. Should you only need 1 scorch, swap the biotic labor in pile #2 for hedge fund, needing only $14.<\/p>\n\n<p>I've included the 1-of SEA source just to keep cheaper kill options open when the runner is poor. In a pinch, the combo can also be used to score a 5\/3 agenda for $10 (requires all 3 jacksons), or a 3\/2 agenda for $2 (only 1 jackson).<\/p>\n\n<p>This will almost certainly auto-lose to noise.<\/p>\n","username":"bblum","cards":{"01059":1,"01086":1,"01094":3,"01095":2,"01099":3,"01101":2,"01103":3,"01110":3,"01111":3,"02018":3,"02019":2,"02077":2,"04015":3,"04034":1,"04040":3,"04052":3,"04058":3,"04060":1,"04100":1,"04111":1,"04117":3,"06009":1,"06068":1,"06071":1}},{"id":10134,"name":"Running in Quicksand","creation":"2014-10-24 18:18:42","description":"<p>Making running your remote servers outrageously expensive, and then putting really nasty things in there with Mushin No Shin.<\/p>\n\n<p>The nice thing about Reversed Accounts is that if you Mushin it, even if the runner reaches it, they're only saving themselves a few credits, versus the cost (in credits and clicks) it took to get there. But often, you'll just want to Mushin out an agenda after the runner is exposed and can't stop you from scoring it next turn (i.e. right after activating an Accounts). The single Junebug, meanwhile, keeps the runner honest.<\/p>\n\n<p>Labyrinthine Servers could just as easily be The Future Perfect, but I like how it can play Inazuma sometimes - Servers + Chum + Komainu will kill the occasional runner. Your mileage may vary. Also, the ICE mix may be all wrong; I think it goes down to personal taste for many of the choices.<\/p>\n","username":"greyfield","cards":{"01068":3,"01069":1,"01075":3,"01110":3,"01111":2,"02031":1,"02110":3,"04015":3,"04054":3,"04060":1,"04119":3,"04120":1,"05006":1,"05009":3,"05014":2,"05015":3,"05016":1,"05017":1,"05018":3,"06003":1,"06022":3,"06063":2,"06066":3}}]

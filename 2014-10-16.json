I kept Viper, but Stronger Together puts <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01063\">Viktor 1.0<\/a> and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02110\">Eli 1.0<\/a> into a very irritating taxing bracket, once the bioroids start doubling up.<\/p>\n\n<p>Doubling up of course being a requirement in order to make the ICE firm up and keep the runner out.

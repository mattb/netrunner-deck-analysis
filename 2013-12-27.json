It fits right in, though.<\/p>\n\n<p>The main idea is to have as many remotes installed and advanced as possible. Even having multiple agendas down isn't bad - I've won with SfK on two agendas that had been there most of the game.<\/p>\n\n<p>Trick of Light is great from a Ronin, or even an agenda, because it pretty much ensures that the runner won't ever run the source of the counters, no matter how many there are on it.<\/p>\n\n<p>I've flatlined a lot with this deck, but took out any tag'n'bag cards. I usually keep 2  counters on a Ronin so if they ever have less than 3 cards, maybe after a Junebug, Snare, or even just ICE and Hokusai, I can sink them the next turn.<\/p>\n\n<p>Thomas is great because he ensures you have the credits for traps, or even to spring ICE when the runner thinks you can't. Having 1 credit and rezzing Wall of Thorns is great - Janus would be even better, but 8 adv counters on Thomas is asking a lot.<\/p>\n\n<p>If I could fit more ICE in here, I would, but I don't know where to get the space. I really only put ICE on the centrals, but R&amp;D lock can be a problem. Bullfrog is still in this version because, dammit, it's fun when it actually does happen, which has been about never.

The breakers are efficient and threatening on all servers, with faerie and crypsis to keep early aggression going while the rig goes up.  Basically its an all around pressure andromeda build, similar to the top 4 MO andromeda at worlds.  This deck tries to always threaten a run anywhere by just having the cash and breakers on board.  It can also go tag-me because most corps, I don't think, would be willing to pay click and 2 credits to trash any of the included resources.  Which explains the lack of certain other ones (SoT, Kati, etc).  Almost everything is designed to be able to be played without significant tempo loss (ironically I start with grifter and CE in the explanation)<\/p>\n\n<p>Odds and ends\/threats<\/p>\n\n<p>Grifter:  Replaces datasucker as archives pressure around mid game, as there is no DS or SNB to pressure that server.  Also with the solid econ here, I should be able to get in to most servers to activate it, and it will do nothing but encourage me to take peaks at servers when I might otherwise be pensive.  Another way to look at it is, once the rig is up, most turns will be MO, MO, MO, Run.  So this saves clicks and lets you continue to get ahead economically.<\/p>\n\n<p>Compromised employee: I've been down on this card, but I think with the NBN influx, the pseudo link is a great feature, lots of trace ice can be negated or put down early if you feel like you need to run (say no opus in opener).  The money back is just icing on the cake, to help repay you for this 'link'.<\/p>\n\n<p>Easy Mark:  This deck is all about tempo.  Easy mark helps me grab that in the opener, like a mini-sure gamble, it allows me to play 2-3 econs, drop magnum and a faeire and discard a duplicate.  Thats pretty much the idea opener.  Yes dirty laundry can be better, and might make its way in, but I want that solid non-stop always threaten stack of cash, and this helps.  I do realize thats a little nonbo with grifter, so we'll see how it shakes out, so far I prefer it because of the opening hand benefit.<\/p>\n\n<p>Infiltration:  Always a nice to see card, worst case its econ if mopus doesn't turn up, but really, in these non-anarch breaker decks, sometimes you have to save yourself a run or two to maintain tempo.  I might go up to 3 if I don't like how other cards are cutting out.<\/p>\n\n<p>Bank job:  Since you can usually make it into a remote, it helps to be able to just snap up 8 credits (desperado makes it the full 8).  Its synergistic with grifter once it's down.  My favorite effect is running an empty remote and trying to get the corp to rez the ice to help keep them poor.  If the runner was about to gain up to 12 credits from bank job and turn on grifter, what would you rez even if you're poor?<\/p>\n\n<p>Why nots?<\/p>\n\n<p>Why not run anarch breakers and suckers like everyone else?<\/p>\n\n<p>I don't like having to mentally balance a path to suckers and manage the time of getting the needed suckers, and aggression.  This method just lets me use money to do it.  And the money helps fight midseasons and sea source if plascrete isn't down.  Keeps up the pressure on weyland.  Basically I feel like this gives me the flexibility I want, while having a remarkably similar effect, and addressing some meta shifts.<\/p>\n\n<p>Why not take out grifter and put in dirty laundry....that also pressures archives?<\/p>\n\n<p>It does, to a point.  Grifter is an ever present threat once its down.  If I feel like I'm losing the grifters too early, then sure, dirty laundry might go in....but I find cards like this typically have intangible benfits that I'd like to try out.  Short answer: Johnny.<\/p>\n\n<p>Why not same old thing?<\/p>\n\n<p>Lets face it.  This is strictly for siphon right?  Every person I play against stacks HQ with ice and doesn't rez the outer one.  Siphons beyond the 3 are tough to pull off later, and I will likely get one early due to the ID ability.  I think 3 is sufficient for what I want to do.  I make enough cash on opus to not worry about it.  I should be able to R&amp;D hard before the big ice come out.<\/p>\n\n<p>Likely changes: -3 Grifter +2 mr li +1 infiltration \/ -3 grifter +1 infil +1 special order +1 bank job.<\/p>\n\n<p>So tell me what you think, try to not be too critical of the grifters, I'm still just testing to see their mid\/mindgame effect<\/p>\n","username":"x3r0h0ur","cards":{"01007":2,"01018":3,"01019":3,"01021":3,"01022":2,"01024":3,"01027":1,"01029":2,"01043":1,"01044":2,"01049":2,"01050":3,"01051":2,"02009":2,"02025":3,"02043":3,"02083":1,"02104":3,"02107":2,"04046":3}},{"id":1139,"name":"NBN Media blitz","creation":"2013-12-27 16:42:38","description":"<p>Can score on 0 credits, can recover fast from siphon.

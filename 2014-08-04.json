[{"id":8232,"name":"Powerhouse Nasir v2.1","creation":"2014-08-04 00:26:56","description":"<p>v2.1: Retooled the icebreaker suite to free up influence from Morning Star. MS is out and 2 <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04003\">Rooks<\/a> are now in to get Nasir more of that sweet, sweet in-run money. And they're also in because I've noticed as more and more people get used to corping against Nasir, you have to play much more of an economic denial game with him - it's not enough to keep your credits on par with what they're losing. You need to be beating them down because there's a growing trend that poses a HUGE problem for Nasir: want to keep him out of a scoring server? No worries - just make sure to get ice 4 or 5 deep before even putting a single agenda down. Protect a Melange or a Pad or a Sundew, even a Jackson behind one or two ice, something the runner probably figures might not be worth the trash run + cost, and then add another piece of ice. And then another. Heck, cap it all off by putting a Pop Up or Ice Wall on the outside, and Nasir can't touch that server for days. So what the heck, I've made room for a few <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01005\">Cyberfeeders<\/a> to see what they can't do for me mid-run. These tweaks are as of yet untested.<\/p>\n\n<hr \/>\n\n<p>After a lot of conversation and some good back-and-forth, I've come to realize that Nasir might actually be one of the best big rig runners in the game. So I've built this deck around the old big-rig adage: \"Efficient breakers, and the rest of your deck for money.\" Corps dread that beefy Shaper econ, and have to build up to make sure they can deal with it by the mid-game, by the time it's usually kicking in. But Nasir's ability, when played with proper Workshop or SMC use, turns economy, rig-building, and runs into the same thing - the main thing the corp usually does to slow you down (rezzing ice) is now the one thing that makes your early game so strong.<\/p>\n\n<p>This decks has econ in the form 2x <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01044\">Magnum Opus<\/a>, and econ\/draw from 3x <a href=\"\/en\/card\/03049\">Professional Contacts<\/a>. These will get you flush with cash to dump into a <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02049\">Personal Workshop<\/a> during your runs, or to pop an SMC and get your big breakers out before your credit pool resets - and that's if the corp chooses to rez in the first place. If you have either your Workshop or an SMC on the table, and start a run with a lot of money, the corp player is forced into a position where they know you can deal with whatever ice they rez, and then have to decide whether it's even worth it to give you the money.<\/p>\n\n<p>New in v2.0, I've retooled the breaker suite and have dropped <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04047\">Torch<\/a> for a <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01043\">Gordian Blade<\/a>. I've also freed up space for 3x <a href=\"\/en\/card\/03040\">Atmans<\/a> by dropping a Clone Chip, an RDI and a Test Run. I found myself overdrawing into these cards more often than not, which might not seem like a bad thing, but recurring with Clone Chip isn't as important as I thought it would be. Plus you only need two RDI's online before each run becomes a Maker's Eye. And running Atman with a rich Nasir should get you into plenty of servers. <\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"\/en\/card\/02106\">Indexing<\/a> is also down to only one copy. I find myself always wanting to hold them for the perfect situations, and those don't come up terribly often once you get out of the early game. The last thing I need is an extra card clogging up my hand, or my deck. <\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"\/en\/card\/02003\">Imp<\/a> stays in as a one-off to help you get rid of any assets should hit a SanSan you can't afford to trash or an NAPD you don't have the money to score (then money up, and snatch it from archives). The deck also runs 3x <a href=\"\/en\/card\/03034\">Scavenges<\/a> to give Imp extra staying power. You can also use it to retool strength on Atman or reposition your Femme token.<\/p>\n\n<p>I've also one-offed a <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02065\">Crescentus<\/a> to add another layer of pressure on the corp. It's the Nasir equivalent of <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02021\">Vamp<\/a>, only more powerful, and acts as a great SMC-able way to kick the corp when they're down.<\/p>\n","username":"BTrain","cards":{"01005":3,"01012":2,"01026":1,"01034":2,"01041":2,"01042":1,"01043":1,"01044":1,"02003":1,"02009":2,"02047":3,"02049":3,"02091":2,"02107":2,"03034":3,"03035":1,"03038":2,"03040":2,"03046":3,"03048":1,"03049":2,"04003":2,"04086":3,"06017":1}},{"id":8233,"name":"HB Control","creation":"2014-08-04 00:51:33","description":"\n","username":"Anima","cards":{"01054":1,"01055":3,"01056":3,"01059":3,"01062":1,"01064":1,"01092":2,"01101":2,"01110":3,"01113":1,"02051":3,"02070":2,"02092":3,"02110":3,"03023":2,"04011":3,"04015":3,"04119":3,"05016":1,"05024":1,"06001":2,"06002":3,"06010":1}},{"id":8235,"name":"Trick\uff01","creation":"2014-08-04 02:20:03","description":"\n","username":"CrAzyZ","cards":{"01069":2,"01081":3,"01090":3,"01092":3,"01109":3,"02055":3,"02059":2,"02115":3,"03009":2,"03012":3,"03023":2,"03025":3,"04015":3,"04119":3,"05015":3,"05023":3,"06003":2,"06005":1,"06010":3}},{"id":8236,"name":"For science.

A nice way to open the match is Sure Gamble + cheap Virus (best is Datasucker) + Dirty Laundry on Archives, which happens rather often. Brings quite a lot of credits and with a little luck the first agenda. <br><br>What really works surprisingly well, are sudden R&D rushes, usually initiated by a Stimhack in order to have enough credits to install Mediums from Personal Workshop or Clone Chips, as well as the for the installation of Parasites and usage of Wyrm to destroy ICE. <br>The then unprotected R&D can be dug deeply. Apart from Agendas it is also absolutely annoying for the Corp if you destroy ICE with Imp-tokens. <br><br>Currently I am really satisfied with the mechanics this deck provides. Though I am considering including some New Angeles City Halls in order to be protected against Sea Source\/Posted Bounty +Scorched Earth or Breaking News + Closed Accounts, as especially the latter is a pain in the ass. Also it allows last-click-runs against potential Snares.<br>I wouldn't know, though, which cards to drop out. Maybe just increase deck size to 48. A resource-tutor would be amazing, but completely overpowered in this deck :)","username":"Ratatosk","cards":{"01001":1,"01002":2,"01004":3,"01005":3,"01006":1,"01008":2,"01009":2,"01010":2,"01012":3,"01013":2,"01015":1,"01016":2,"01026":1,"01050":3,"02003":3,"02022":3,"02041":1,"02049":2,"03038":3,"03052":3,"03053":3}},{"id":646,"name":"Off the grid vHJ.1","creation":"2013-11-24 21:12:18","description":"My idea for an OtG deck. Corporate troubleshooter to make sure the runner can't get in when you need to keep him out.  Extra nice if you can use it on an Archer. :)<br>Minelayer to help with instal costs on HQ. Ice up archives as well, especially vs criminal and keep a CTS for archives vs a sneakdoor beta. Everything else is money.

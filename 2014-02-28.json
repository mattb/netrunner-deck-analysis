Once you land a bad pub, you sit back and wait.  I will probably try it with the other bad pub options as well, activist support and tallie.  Hopefully there will be more to come from ffg.  A similar build in criminal might work well, could use running interference for a similar effect to blackmail.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Played a few games with it and it's about as awkward as you would expect, replacing notoriety, frame job black mail with vamp, medium and imp would be a better deck.  Once they have bad pub it can be pretty annoying, but even then it means you can never run their remote without blackmailing it, so it's easy to bait you into running at a trap or upgrade.  Also unlike vamp, blackmail doesn't hurt the corps Econ, so if you miss or score they are still in a good position.  Also fast advance makes you lose.  The source slows them down for a turn, but I found even an extra turn isn't enough to get the whole bad pub thing setup.  You need to draw your knights and blackmails early, Econ, a frame job, and score an agenda or notoriety, then you are in a good position.  <\/p>\n","username":"Garbo","cards":{"01002":3,"01012":3,"01049":3,"01050":3,"01051":3,"01053":3,"02001":1,"02026":3,"02091":3,"02105":3,"03053":3,"03054":3,"03055":3,"04001":3,"04043":3,"04089":3}},{"id":2732,"name":"My Personal Shell Game v2","creation":"2014-02-28 14:23:40","description":"\n","username":"mhoroszowski","cards":{"01067":1,"01068":2,"01069":2,"01070":2,"01072":3,"01075":1,"01076":1,"01077":1,"01107":1,"01108":2,"01110":3,"01111":1,"02015":1,"02032":3,"02033":2,"02080":1,"02112":1,"02120":1,"03009":3,"03023":1,"04012":2,"04013":1,"04015":1,"04032":3,"04039":1,"04071":1,"04073":2,"04074":1,"04079":3,"04092":1,"04093":1}},{"id":2733,"name":"Noise.

From here, the middle ICE can be taken care of with Knights or Parasite.<\/p>\n\n<p>Magnum Opus is a necessity over Professional Contacts in this deck. It can be modded in for value, and provides a stable economy to make sure your rig can be SMC'd exactly when needed. A worthy note, Stimhack can pull out an Omega for free with a SMC installed, at the cost of one brain damage. Be cautious using this tactic when playing against Jinteki!<\/p>\n\n<p>Since Rielle relies on making one good run per turn, 3x R&amp;D Interfaces make her runs super worth.

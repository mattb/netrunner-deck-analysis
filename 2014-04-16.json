Originally, I ran singletons of breakers but after having a few unlucky games where either I wasn't drawing what I needed or hitting a trash effect, I went with additional copies of my corroder and peacock. I then changed from a ninja to a Femme with faerie support to protect against power shutdown. An overall great decision as I went undefeated with both my Corp and Runner decks.<\/p>\n\n<p>The deck is able to establish a strong economy very quickly and threaten R&amp;D, HQ and any remotes effectively and strongly. <\/p>\n\n<p>The two of keyhole ensures I get it quick, sometimes even on first turn where I would happily use an account siphon or hedge fund followed by keyhole and two R&amp;D runs. Basically I work to make them as scared as possible of siphons and keyhole and then only use those effects in the most opportunistic way possible.<\/p>\n\n<p>This slows down the corp greatly and results in much thinner ice on remote servers. From there on out, infiltration will suss out when an opponent plays an agenda and inside job\/blackmail\/stimhack or just strong economy will break the server to steal it. If playing against a fast advance deck, I like to make selective runs against HQ especially with the hopes of breaking their economy with a well timed account siphon. (Say after they spent much of their money on a biotic labor) At that point, run keyhole hard looking to kill agendas and key cards.<\/p>\n\n<p>The most important strategic thing you can do with this deck is changing the board state drastically at an unexpected time. That is, don't play a same old thing until you're going to use it. Verify that you're going to hit an agenda using those infiltration before that. Basically abuse what the corp expects to be a safe scoring window or make them overextend themselves and take advantage. Remember, as a runner you have much greater control of scoring windows than the corp does.<\/p>\n","username":"ExplodyCat","cards":{"01004":2,"01007":2,"01018":3,"01021":3,"01022":3,"01024":2,"01026":1,"01049":3,"01050":3,"02006":2,"02009":2,"02083":1,"02091":2,"02104":2,"02105":1,"03035":1,"03052":3,"03053":3,"03054":3,"04061":2,"04089":2}}]

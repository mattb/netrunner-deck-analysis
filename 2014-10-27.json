I was 2-2 with the deck.<\/p>\n\n<p>Things of note:<\/p>\n\n<p>1.) This deck has a terrible awful nogood matchup versus Jinteki. I'm pretty sure the Corroder should be a Mimic. Komainu was a pain in the butt.<\/p>\n\n<p>2.) I assumed that Queen's Gambit would be a dead draw against a reasonable amount of decks, but I found that I wanted to draw it pretty much every game. Usually it's pretty easy to tell when a card definitely isn't an agenda. It's probably dead against Supermodernism (or Weyland in general), unless you can hit a Jackson with it.<\/p>\n\n<p>3.) A ton of low-strength, high-subroutine ice is surprisingly this deck's weakness. Since most of my breakers or \"breakers\" require me to use one of a limited amount of counters, there's less of a return in value if I'm breaking a Quandary with Overmind than something like a Tollbooth with D4v1d.<\/p>\n\n<p>4.) E3 continues to be the all-star in this deck, mostly unsurprisingly.<\/p>\n\n<p>5.) I discovered more utility from Scavenge than just resetting counters on programs: Activating Duggar's and then pitching stuff lets me trade a counterless Imp for whatever I happened to throw away. And since all of the cards in the deck cost 3 or less except for Overmind, it's usually free or close to it.<\/p>\n\n<p>6.) As much as I love Parasite, it was one of the weak points of the deck.

If you come in to the late game with a heavy advantage due to tagging or taxing, look to force the runner in to unfavorable plays.

They dump those credits like mad to rez ICE, dump in assets, whatever. After passing all the ICE, I like to forgoe the effect, access HQ with HQ Interface, then Emergency shutdown that Curtain Wall. In the mid-late game I now own them. Run wherever I want, they can't afford to rez ICE. If they Oversight AI to try and get back some cash...SOT to stop that. I don't know how much longer I can get away with that basic idea.<\/p>\n\n<p>Is this a tournament-level competitive deck? I seriously doubt it. But it is FUN!!!

This could, potentially, be done by using 3 Forged Activation Orders, 3 Parasites, 3 Clone Chips to recur 3 Parasites, 3 Deja Vu's to recur 6 Parasite, and 3 Same Old Things to recur 3 Deja Vu's to recur 6 Parasites. In total, that is 21 killed pieces of ice. You can then repeat the process with a Levy AR Lab Access, which totals for 42 pieces of dead ice. This is not the optimal way to use the deck (for example, Same Old Thing can be more useful in reusing Inject). However, it does show you the upside and power of the deck, which is to chew ice to pieces. Furthermore, you may be facing Lotus Fields. Forged Activation Orders is the best means by which to destroy this card, so it may be optimal to recur the Forged Activation Orders rather than Parasites in some situations.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Use Forged Activation Orders on ice that has cost increased through Reina Roja's ability + Xanadu + Rooks. <\/p>\n\n<p>Run <em>constantly<\/em>. Reina's ability + Rooks + Xanadu mean that the corp will have to pay up to 5 credits to rez even a 1 cost ice. This is only effective if you run, so you <em>must<\/em> run, as frequently as is feasible. Make them go broke by faceplanting into ice which you will then kill using Parasites. <\/p>\n\n<p>Your optimal situation involves having out Medium, Keyhole, Deep Red, Xanadu, a Rook on R&amp;D, and some means of killing any ice. You then Keyhole run R&amp;D constantly, killing any card that helps the corp's strategy (pay attention to traps, fast advance cards, Howard Jacksons, and economy). A perfect turn consists of three Keyhole runs on R&amp;D, followed by a normal run with a now-jacked-up Medium. The corp can either purge virus counters or let you do this same routine the next turn, with so much access at the end of the run that you're almost ensured a large number of agenda points. If they try to stop you, they will have to pay large amounts of money to rez ice, which you can use to make them poor and then run a remote server and close their scoring window. <\/p>\n\n<p>Your weaknesses will be tags and damage. You have enough recursion that losing cards to damage is moot, anything can be brought back from your heap multiple times, but be sure to keep your hand full as frequently as possible. Inject and Duggar's should make this easy, but click to draw as necessary. You have no other defense against damage. There are enough resources in this deck that Tag Me is not an option. Kill tags as they come, and be sure to trash anything that can tag you using Keyhole. <\/p>\n\n<p>You have the advantage of 1 Link strength, so you already have a leg up on traces, do not forget that, keep credits as necessary to deal with potential traces. <\/p>\n","username":"17thknight","cards":{"01002":3,"01007":2,"01008":2,"01010":2,"01011":2,"01012":3,"01014":2,"01015":1,"01020":3,"01050":3,"02082":2,"02091":2,"03035":1,"03038":3,"03054":3,"04003":3,"04041":1,"04042":2,"04043":2,"04061":2,"06054":1,"06073":3}},{"id":10250,"name":"Fast-Advance Hub","creation":"2014-10-27 19:20:22","description":"<p>It's fast advance.

Every piece of ice in this deck either ETRs or re-enables an ETR ice when they get the breaker down. Corporate Troubleshooter and WOTW help keep the advantage when they get breakers for those down, too. Off the Grid gives you a great scoring remote once you can get HQ locked down enough that they don't have enough clicks to get in, though the deck isn't dependent on it. Interns and Jackson the stuff they trash so you can make your centrals dangerous again. It's worked really well for me and it's a lot of fun to play.<\/p>\n\n<p>For those wondering, yes, this idea would probably work better in Blue Sun with some tweaking, but I haven't had too much time to play with the new pack yet. I've been meaning to give it a try, though.<\/p>\n","username":"talking_chicken","cards":{"01065":2,"01090":3,"01093":1,"01094":3,"01101":2,"01103":2,"01110":3,"02018":3,"02070":3,"02077":3,"03026":2,"04015":2,"04017":1,"04020":2,"04038":2,"04040":3,"04060":2,"05024":2,"06003":2,"06032":2,"06047":2,"06048":3}},{"id":10259,"name":"Smart Sun V2","creation":"2014-10-27 23:53:24","description":"<p>Much better version than the original Smart Sun after more testing. The deck suffered when runners decided not to run HQ, making you unable to perform the combo.

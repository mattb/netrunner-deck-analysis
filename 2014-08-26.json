[{"id":8969,"name":"Dinomite v3 (1st, Auckland Regionals)","creation":"2014-08-26 01:20:40","description":"<p>This is an updated version of my Chronos Protocol winning decklist <a href=\"http:\/\/netrunnerdb.com\/en\/decklist\/4715\/dinomite-1st-auckland-chronos-protocol-\">Dinomite<\/a>. For a more detailed analysis of the deck check the <a href=\"http:\/\/netrunnerdb.com\/en\/decklist\/4715\/dinomite-1st-auckland-chronos-protocol-\">original list<\/a>. Here I\u2019ll just cover the changes to the deck since <a href=\"http:\/\/netrunnerdb.com\/en\/decklist\/5755\/dinomite-v2-1st-auckland-vagabond-store-championship-\">Dinomite v2<\/a> and how they performed on the day.<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>-1 Inside Job<\/li>\n<li>+1 Legwork<\/li>\n<li>+1 Stimhack<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Some slight changes to influence. Legwork was my target for Planned Assault and Same Old Thing so often that I added a second copy. Vamp would be another good choice. Stimhack adds a bit of speed and I'm happy to have it back.<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>-2 Plascrete Carapace<\/li>\n<li>-1 Deus X<\/li>\n<li>-1 Levy AR Lab Access<\/li>\n<li>+1 Feedback Filter<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>I've been comfortable overpowering Weyland economy with Magnum Opus so the Plascretes came out. Levy AR Lab Access simply wasn't needed as the deck doesn't need to draw for economy unlike PPvP Kate. I hadn't found myself using Deus X, it caused occasional MU problems and I wasn't getting as much use out of it without Clone Chips. In their place is the strongest Jinteki defence out there, Feedback Filter. With credits on hand you are almost impossible to flatline or deck. During the tournament I installed Feedback Filter when my opponent's RP showed some teeth. It let me avoid some work compression to continue my run and steal a Fetal AI that would have otherwise killed me.<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>+1 Cyber-Cyber<\/li>\n<li>+1 Quality Time<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>With the free slots I sped the deck up adding a cheap codegate SMC option with Cyber-Cypher which also works well with Scavenge. It rescued my Magnum Opus from the heap early one game and in another, after they trashed their remote codegate I scavenged it to R&amp;D to land Indexing.<\/p>\n\n<p>The deck performed reasonably in a meta of NBN and RP going 1-1 against both archetypes which was luckily enough with my superbye and strong corp performance. The game I lost to RP had an amazing start, landing Account Siphon trashing several economy assets and scoring a quick 4 points with a commanding credit lead. Then, Sundew behind a Quandary. I'd already popped SMC and Testrun for my initial assault grabbing Femme and Corroder. That Sundew must have brought in 20+ credits and he was able to slowly claw his way back into the game. I scored another NAPD to reach 6 points but lost a couple Psi games and he closed it out. In my bottom 5 cards were Test Run, Test Run, Torch, Cyber-Cypher. I think it was a mistake not to run a third SMC in the deck.<\/p>\n\n<h2>The Spaces Between Update<\/h2>\n\n<p>I'm currently testing what I call Dinomite Hi-Lo where I've diversified breakers grabbing both ends of the spectrum; Torch\/Cyber-Cypher and Morning Star\/Inti. This allows quick cheap SMC answers and Test Run or lategame big rig. Morning Star and Inti are well positioned for a barrier meta of Eli 1.0, Wraparound and NEXT Silver.<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>+1 Self-modifying Code<\/li>\n<li>+1 Morning Star<\/li>\n<li>+1 Inti<\/li>\n<li>-1 Corroder<\/li>\n<li>-1 Legwork<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Inspired by a CT deck that handed my NBN its' only loss I'm also considering a swap to Personal Workshop. The 'take 8 credits' turn become 9 with a Personal Workshop ticking, particularly helpful keeping up with RP and NEH assets. With breakers loaded on Personal Workshop you can also force the corp to rez ice before you have to pay for them.<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>+2 Personal Workshop<\/li>\n<li>-2 Modded<\/li>\n<li>-1 Sure Gamble<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>The change would not be without its' drawbacks. I actually had workshop in my earliest build but my opponents would force through SEA Source or Breaking News just to trash it so I learned to love going tag-me with multiple siphons. The deck also becomes a bit less explosive, telegraphing your moves to the corp. In the end I suspect that going through the NEH testing grinder will fully commit me to Personal Workshop, switching the run events for more R&amp;D\/HQ Interfaces.<\/p>\n\n<p>If you've got any questions, ideas or lessons from testing against NEH I'd love it hear it. :)<\/p>\n","username":"Fjord","cards":{"01004":1,"01007":1,"01018":1,"01026":2,"01034":3,"01035":2,"01044":3,"01050":3,"02046":1,"02047":3,"02048":2,"02087":1,"02106":3,"02107":1,"03034":3,"03037":1,"03044":1,"03046":2,"03054":3,"04047":1,"05035":2,"05036":1}},{"id":8970,"name":"androdm","creation":"2014-08-26 04:27:21","description":"<p>2nd place after swiss and 3rd after top 16 at german nationals (85 players)<\/p>\n","username":"servas","cards":{"01007":2,"01008":3,"01011":1,"01014":1,"01018":3,"01021":2,"01022":3,"01024":3,"01026":1,"01050":3,"01051":1,"02009":2,"02043":2,"02083":1,"02091":2,"02104":3,"02107":3,"03052":3,"04009":1,"05035":3,"05046":1,"05048":3}},{"id":8971,"name":"Reina Necromancer","creation":"2014-08-26 07:21:51","description":"\n","username":"Gygrazok","cards":{"01002":2,"01004":1,"01005":2,"01006":1,"01007":1,"01008":2,"01011":1,"01012":3,"01014":1,"01015":1,"01018":2,"01026":1,"01050":3,"02004":1,"02009":2,"02022":2,"02028":2,"02082":2,"02087":2,"02091":2,"02101":3,"03052":2,"03053":2,"03054":3,"04041":1,"04047":1}},{"id":8972,"name":"vulcan, go to your room! anti-AI edition","creation":"2014-08-26 08:34:51","description":"<p>Mother goddess locks off HQ, while off the grid allows advancement at my leisure.

One day I read an article that said the most important thing for an Anarch to know: Destroy everything, let them have nothing. <\/p>\n\n<p>With that I decided to be nearly hyper-focused on my goal, which was mainly to cause chaos, destroy as much as possible, and make the corp hate life.<\/p>\n\n<p>I think most of my choices are somewhat obvious, but I'd like to explain the couple that aren't:<\/p>\n\n<p>Hemmorage: Most people find it \"too slow\", and I think that is for a couple of reasons. 1) They don't use 3 copies. I feel like it's all-in or not at all to make it totally effective. 2) It's not going to be used as often as you want, but that extra pressure goes a long way when you're already blowing other things up and then they're forced to choose. In rapid fashion, along side Imp, I find their hand size dwindles to the point where, if they have just one or two cards, there's 1-2 agendas there.<\/p>\n\n<p>Express Delivery: I've tried this in other decks and it never seemed to work. Anarch needs a big dig that's not Expensive, High Influence, or Wyldside. ED just works when you need to dig faster, and it gets you a shuffle to boot.<\/p>\n\n<p>The combination of hand and econ disruption is just a killer in this deck. Stack on Whiz's free trash creds and this is one mean machine. <\/p>\n\n<p>I should also mention that tag-me isn't as dead as it might seem. Our meta is strong and diverse and despite the threats this deck avoids most of the pitfalls by needing little cash to get by. I could click for creds most of the time and still do very well. Further, Josh B and DLR along with the other trashing I do has seen several near-mill wins. That's still the hardest win to achieve in my mind but this deck pushes the pace hard.

There was a series of turns where I needed to draw agendas and was not.<\/p>\n\n<p>2) One scored <a href=\"\/en\/card\/06001\">Domestic Sleepers<\/a> is enough with this agenda set, and 2 scored doesn't help the corp, so agenda composition is all 3 pointers and now 2 Domestic Sleepers.<\/p>\n\n<p>3) Aside from expensive \"one of's\", core ice should be pairs or triplets.<\/p>\n\n<p>4) This identity increases agenda density because we remove extra ice from R&amp;D therefore defending it is important. (We have built in Indexing protection - with either unrezzed ice on R&amp;D or a <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02060\">Chimera<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n<p>5) Grail ice with this identity will be effective because ice in hand are never dead cards. NEXT and Grail together with <a href=\"\/en\/card\/06010\">Mother Goddess<\/a> will be very efficient and effective.<\/p>\n\n<p>6) This identity naturally protects HQ because extra ice can just be held to make space. (<a href=\"\/en\/card\/04012\">Celebrity Gift<\/a> is an economy option)<\/p>\n\n<p>7) This identity wants to rez ice, which means the runner needs to run. If the runner tries to just focus one server they can potentially deplete our money and then pressure other servers unhindered.  <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02038\">Amazon Industrial Zone<\/a> counters this, allowing the ability to proc on the runner AND corp's turn. It is also a nice economy option and can get an oppressive scoring remote established quickly.<\/p>\n\n<p>8) This identity can theoretically allow us to run fewer ice and be fine, thus freeing up deck slots. Someone with a more mathematical mind than me should crunch some numbers.<\/p>\n\n<p>Economy: Since this is a Red Coats style deck, and is not HB:EtF,  extra economy cards were added. Sometimes the game state demands the corp \"turtle up\" so aside from installing ice, the economy should be click efficient. <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01056\">Adonis Campaign<\/a> requires no clicks to use and can be initially set up in a scoring server. Same with <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02059\">Private Contracts<\/a> except you can control how quickly you drain it and is also effective in a scoring server. <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01108\">Melange Mining Corp.<\/a> is an experiment, but it forces the runner to deal with it, which means you will probably rez ice to defend it.<\/p>\n\n<p>Misc: <a href=\"\/en\/card\/05012\">Tenma Line<\/a> is an experiment. If the runner has an Atman on good numbers or the appropriate breakers, rearranging ice may be the key to creating a scoring window. <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04079\">Punitive Counterstrike<\/a> is also an experiment, but is a back up plan if you catch them off guard when they steal a 3 pointer.

Leaving out Indexing was a huge oversight, and I've thinned out my hardware to make room for 2 copies of it. HQ Interface was dropped from 2 to 1, which freed up 2 inf. for Hostage - and that let me drop Kati and ProCo both to 2. Trimming a mem chip left me with room for 3 SOT's which, in testing, the deck had been desperately lacking. What we're left with in this version is an efficient deck that can pressure when and where it wants, be it through programs or events. And It will only get better once Astrolabe and Trade-In drop.<\/p>\n\n<p>Possible changes include swapping out an Akamatsu for a CyberSolutions, because as it stands now, there are just some games in which you'll have to accept that you can't put down a Sneakdoor because of memory constrictions; but then there are also games where a good Sneakdoor play isn't as efficient as it could be because of early ice on archives, so I don't think the slot warrants the extra 3c to get memory on the board. That could change with more testing.<\/p>\n\n<p>You could also look at swapping out a Datasucker for another Femme because there have been times where being able to bypass multiple pieces of ice is a huge help. But with the inclusion of Same Old Thing to beef up the recurrence Scavenge, I'll be sticking with the extra Datasucker.<\/p>\n\n<p>Imp still wrecks days.

And if you're afraid of nasty ice or a Junebug, tutor out your Deus X, and remember safe practices: don't run last click, leave creds to clear tags, etc. etc.<\/p>\n\n<p>I'd love for people to test this deck and see what they find.

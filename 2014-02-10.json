My most recent success was tieing for 3rd\/4th with it and my Weyland Tag N' Bag deck at the 36 person ChiLo City Grudge Match in Louisville, KY.<\/p>\n\n<p>It's not too complicated to play. It has extreme economy with all of it's hefty resources as well as run based economy. Hostage has four targets, three of which are economy boosts and if out early, can have you set for the rest of the game. The singleton Decoy is for when you really need that early Scorch protection and either Plascrete isn't available or the Power Shutdown\/Accelerated Diagnostics deck being used. You'll notice, there are not any Account Siphons. I tend to shy away from the cards everyone else uses, but since this was heavily resourced based, I did not want to deal with tags constantly. But recently, after reevaluating the deck and that card, I think I can at least get a couple in without harming this build.<\/p>\n","username":"KingOfOdonata","cards":{"01007":2,"01008":2,"01014":1,"01020":2,"01021":3,"01022":2,"01024":3,"01027":2,"01029":2,"01032":1,"01047":1,"01050":3,"01053":3,"02006":1,"02009":2,"02043":2,"02083":1,"02091":1,"02107":2,"03049":1,"03052":3,"03053":3,"04004":3}},{"id":2103,"name":"Knighthood Gabe","creation":"2014-02-10 00:30:08","description":"\n","username":"bennyside","cards":{"01007":1,"01017":1,"01018":3,"01020":2,"01021":3,"01022":3,"01024":2,"01026":1,"01028":2,"01029":2,"01030":2,"01036":2,"01050":3,"01051":1,"02007":1,"02024":1,"02043":2,"02091":1,"02104":2,"03052":2,"03054":2,"04002":1,"04004":3,"04009":1,"04043":3}},{"id":2104,"name":"Heimdall Weyland Tag N' Bag-3rd\/4th @ ChiLo Grudge Match","creation":"2014-02-10 00:51:36","description":"<p>This Corp got me to the top 4 at the ChiLo City Grudge Match in Louisville,KY, along side my Andromeda Connections deck.

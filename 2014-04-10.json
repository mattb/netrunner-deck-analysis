By stacking at least two Bioroids on every server, it's super painful to run on a server with credits or clicks. This reinforces the name of the identity - Stronger Together. ST also means Viktor 1.0 is usable against Yog :)<\/p>\n\n<p>Focus efforts on centrals while setting up a decent remote to FA in and some scattered econ assets. <\/p>\n\n<p>I use a lot of FA in this deck because the deck is too porous to be relied on to actually stop runners most of the time (which is why I also don't run Successful Demonstration). Luckily, all of the econ should be able to support the FA nicely.<\/p>\n\n<p>Counters (in rough order of efficacy):<\/p>\n\n<p>E3 Implants - Just brutal against the deck<\/p>\n\n<p>Aggressive Runners - Takes a while to setup the deck, so fast runners like CT and just about any criminal gives this deck trouble. However, if you manage to muscle through the early game, your late game is so much stronger.<\/p>\n\n<p>Whizzard: If he trashes your econ assets early you're in some deep trouble<\/p>\n\n<p>Morning Star + Paintbrush - Costly to setup, but effective.

Two losses to a Weyland Accelerated Diagnostics combo with Power Shutdown and Scorched and another loss to an HB FA deck in which my opponent managed to beta test (2x) a 5 deep super ice remote which cost me over 20 credits to get into.<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Starting Hand: ideal would be 2 econ, 1 hostage, 1 special order, random icebreaker. I will mulligan if I do not see an econ card or a breaker.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Ideal rig: Datasucker, 3 breakers, nerve or keyhole<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Hostage: getting out Pro Contacts in the first three turns is key, it will help you set up your rig fast and enable you to keep a steady flow of burst econ cards.  The first hostage will definitely be to find pro contacts, Katie second.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Datasucker\/Mimic: If you can get an early data sucker, it will make your mimic unbeatable. If you can't get an early datasucker, install crypsis (and leave out Yog) so you will never be locked out to get Datasucker tokens when everything is iced up.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Crypsis: against sentry heavy decks I prefer to run a combo of crypsis and mimic instead of Yog and mimic. Crypsis will get you past codegates just fine and will make sure you keep getting datasucker tokens for when you run out. When the datasucker is filled up again switch to mimic.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Keynote\/Nerve Agent: you will only have room to install one or the other and you should only install one of them anyway. Attack the weakest server and when they ice that up heavily just trash keyhole\/nerve agent and install the other one. I can't yell you how many games I've won in one turn with this move. Early keyholes will destroy Jinteki and Weyland damage builds.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Why no parasite?: I have another version of this deck with three parasites instead of imps which works fine as well but in the end I rarely used parasite because without clone chips\/SMCs they are just to click intensive.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Imp: use imp to trash ice, scorched, econ cards and use Whizzards recurring creds to trash assets like Jackson, pads and ashes.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>It is important to face check the first ice in front of centrals in your first 2 turns before installing breakers. This way you can special order the breaker you need to get into one of them. If you don't want to do this (against Jinteki for example) special order Crypsis as your first breaker, though you also need mimic to deal with swordsman and be completely safe (but who needs safe all the time, live a little!).<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>This deck will net you a LOT of money and I've out moneyed NBN and GRNDL decks without problems but it will slow you down. In these cases I like to take some risks and use imp to trash key combo cards (keyhole can also be used for this of course). Sometimes this means you will end turns with a 10 credit gap (between you and the corp) and can be in danger but I'd rather be an active runner and occasionally flatline than only use clicks for money (though you can and you will keep up with the corp if you do). Collecting money only is not playing Netrunner anyway, it is you being a scared little !*@&amp; (and I'm guilty of that one as well :D).<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","username":"Solforger","cards":{"01006":3,"01007":3,"01008":3,"01011":3,"01014":2,"01022":3,"01050":3,"01051":1,"02001":1,"02003":3,"02009":2,"02022":3,"02041":2,"02091":2,"03049":1,"03052":3,"03053":3,"04004":3,"04061":2}},{"id":4061,"name":"But I just paid for that?","creation":"2014-04-10 07:57:06","description":"<p>Create ICE to either scare off the runner or they pay not to die and then pay some more because they have to gamble for the steal.<\/p>\n","username":"sjnorval","cards":{"01064":2,"01067":1,"01068":3,"01070":3,"01074":2,"01075":2,"01076":2,"01077":3,"01078":3,"01110":3,"02014":3,"02032":3,"02034":2,"02112":2,"03023":2,"04012":3,"04015":2,"04033":2,"04034":3,"04040":2,"04054":1,"04099":1,"04114":2,"04117":3,"04119":2}},{"id":4062,"name":"Gabe - HQ Knights 040414","creation":"2014-04-10 10:10:57","description":"\n","username":"brAnDeD","cards":{"01007":1,"01008":2,"01012":2,"01014":1,"01017":1,"01018":3,"01019":2,"01020":3,"01021":3,"01022":3,"01024":1,"01026":1,"01028":2,"01029":2,"01050":3,"01051":1,"01053":3,"02009":3,"02085":2,"04009":2,"04043":3,"04063":2}},{"id":4063,"name":"Weyland BBW - Specialty Meats 040414","creation":"2014-04-10 10:12:40","description":"\n","username":"brAnDeD","cards":{"01070":3,"01086":2,"01088":1,"01093":1,"01094":3,"01098":3,"01099":3,"01101":2,"01103":3,"01106":2,"01110":3,"02018":3,"02019":3,"04015":3,"04017":3,"04058":3,"04078":1,"04079":3,"04117":2,"04120":3}},{"id":4064,"name":"Accelerated Shipment from Hand v3","creation":"2014-04-10 11:03:45","description":"<p><strong>Up Front<\/strong> -- this is a cheese deck, and although not completely competitive, it can win enough.

It will take 9-12 cards, and 3-13 credits for the bulk of the win conditions.  The trick is figuring it out.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Backing up:<\/strong><br \/>\nYou want to draw -- draw as much as you can.  Use the X-level clearances, the Anonymous Tips, and even Jackson Howard, although <em>NEVER<\/em> remove him from the game.  Do not blind play a hedge fund unless you need it.  The draw is often better, and the Hedge Fund is nice to have in hand for Siphon recovery.<\/p>\n\n<p>The trickiest part of this is that you actually WANT to discard the Shipment from SanSan.  To do this, you want to be careful about keeping hand and credits about the same.<\/p>\n\n<p>ICE selection is just meant to be a spread, and cheap to rez.  They don't really stop for long, just slow down hopefully.  Pick whatever you like, but keep it cheap.  Use Guard instead of Roto if you want, it doesn't insta-die to a parasite, but then again the surprise program trash is a good way to slow things down.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Combo up:<\/strong> \nNow solve the puzzle.  When can you win outright from your hand?  You'll need  minimum of 9 cards, and typically 10, accounted for in many varied combinations.  The only card you absolutely need is Power Shutdown, then if you view Interns and Archived Memories as wild cards you just need to account for the other 9 and sprinkle in Biotic as need be.

The reason one needs to be a Shipment from Kaguya is because you need to finish off the odd numbered agendas.<\/p>\n\n<p>There are <em>MANY<\/em> ways to win--the challenge is in figuring out the puzzle.  Total number of clicks is <strong>15<\/strong>:  12 (advances), 3 (installs).  So the puzzle is in getting those extra 12 clicks to get up to 15, and there are many ways.  Primarily, the Accelerated Diagnostics gains +5 clicks if you use it with 3 <em>double<\/em> cards.  However, it cost a click for Power shutdown, and a click to install Jackson Howard so the first Accelerated Diagnostics will <em>net<\/em> you at most +3 clicks.  Being as Power Shutdown only needs to fire once, the 2nd Accelerated Diagnostics can gain you 4 more.  Shipment from Mirrormorph gains you 2 clicks, Efficiency Committee gains 3 more, and Shipment from Kaguya gains 1 click.<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/netrunnerdb.com\/en\/card\/04052\">Accelerated Diagnostics<\/a> x2 (7 clicks)<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/netrunnerdb.com\/en\/card\/03005\">Efficiency Committee<\/a> (3 clicks)<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/netrunnerdb.com\/en\/card\/01060\">Shipment from MirrorMorph<\/a> (2 clicks)<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/netrunnerdb.com\/en\/card\/01100\">Shipment from Kaguya<\/a> (1 click)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p><em>Total:<\/em>  16  (adding the 3 normal clicks)<\/p>\n\n<p>Easy right?  There is even a spare click there to Archived Memories up something we need.  Well -- not so easy.  2 reasons:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>You do not always have all the cards you need, and so you have to make concessions from the optimal path, which is using all Shipment from SanSan with your Accelerated Diagnostics.<\/li>\n<li><em>When<\/em> the clicks are used is extremely important.  You don't get an advance up-front on them all, and you have to generate as you go.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>Once you have the base math in your head, you can begin to recognize when its go-time.  If you don't have a card you need in hand, then add a click to sub a wild card (Archived Memories).  Compensate with Biotic Labor for each of these needed.  If you have a 2nd Vitrivius in place of an Efficiency Committee you can either A.  add a click (i.e. one less advance needed), or B. add a click (over-advance and one less Archived Memories to play).   Not using Efficiency Committee then only loses you 2 clicks, which can be purchased for 8 credits with Biotic Labor x2.<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>+1 click if your opponent leaves a Jackson Howard on the table for you.<\/li>\n<li>+4 clicks if you go through a 3rd Accelerated Diagnostics.  Although typically you only do this in trickier combos.<\/li>\n<li>-1 clicks when you play a non-double with Accelerated Diagnostics.<\/li>\n<li>-1 click to \"find\" a card in archives with Archived Memories or Interns.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p><strong>Key Points<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Typically you want 5 of your Shipment from SanSan's to fire through the Accelerated Diagnostics.  Anything else amounts to a click-loss.  If this is not possible due to one of them being in your hand, you need to account for the click-loss.<\/li>\n<li>Normally you are looking to fire through an Efficiency Committee to gain 3 clicks, however it is possile to use a 2nd Vitruvius instead.<\/li>\n<li>It helps to see a Shipment from Mirrormorph <strong>OR<\/strong> an Interns in the archives.<\/li>\n<li>It is possible to do it without a Jackson in hand or on table, but normally you want one in your hand.<\/li>\n<li>Sometimes they leave a Jackson on table (not smart) -- then everything gets easier.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p><strong>Key Ommissions:<\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/netrunnerdb.com\/en\/card\/04072\">Panic Button<\/a>.

There's lots more research and studying to do with this deck.<\/p>\n\n<p>Key topics:\nMushin no shin and trick of light are your scoring engines.  These two operations should be reused with archives memories as much as possible.<\/p>\n\n<p>Mulligan for Mushin no shin or Econ.  1 ETR ice should suffice with a Mushin.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Turn 1:  Mushin no shin a plan b or junebug or gamble and stick ice down over any agenda.<\/p>\n\n<p>Turn 2 - 3: focus on Econ, and advancing ice wall and shadow.<\/p>\n\n<p>Turn 4:  if you have trick of light, score your 2nd agenda to make it match point.  If not, turn four will focus more on Econ and drawing.<\/p>\n\n<p>The principles still apply in the FA.  A 3\/2 will be scored if you have two advancement tokens on advance-able ice and a trick of light.  Even. The 4\/2 can be scored in one with 2 trick of lights and 4 tokens on ice.  Between razzing ice and advancing them\/tokens, you should be pretty poor, so save your Mushin no shin for the right times.<\/p>\n\n<p>Since it's fairly easy to score out f hand, ice can be focused on central servers as needed.  (Be real careful with R&amp;D multiaccess).  Account siphon is annoying but you don't really need Econ if you spent the first 3 turns spending money in the right places.<\/p>\n\n<p>Weaknesses:\nIf you don't ice up R&amp;D against multiaccess (interface and Maker), you will fail...<\/p>\n\n<p>Account siphon is annoying if you haven't rezzed a lot of ice.  Once your ice is all rezzed, let them take what they want and try and score your first two agendas fast.  You should take comfort in he fact that Mushin no shin on a plan b, junebug, or agenda will put just as much pressure on the runner even if you have no credits.<\/p>\n\n<p>Knight seems to be the best card against this FA decks.  It seriously is the worst card to deal with.  So be sure to keep your central servers clear of those as much as possible.<\/p>\n\n<p>I think with expose, you might lose some edge in the guessing game, so be aware if your opponents like to expose your perfectly set traps.  If so, trick of light seems to salvage those Mushin tokens.  <\/p>\n\n<p>For year 3.0, I'm looking to you peers for evaluation and review.

The ice is a mix of early (Paper Wall, Enigma, Wall of Static), mid (RSVP, Bastion, Grim) and late (Tollbooth, Archer, Flare) game. Security Subcontract trashes your Pop-Ups and Paper Walls before the runner gets a chance to, turning them into cash to fuel either your fast advance or beefier ice on your centrals. RSVP protects SanSan and Haas - it'll cost the runner 8 credits to get through and trash either with a Gordian, or they'll have to acquire a Datasucker token in combo with Yog.<\/p>\n\n<p>Economy is standard Operations fair, with Gila Hans and Security Subcontract for on-demand bursts if needed. <\/p>\n\n<p>Director Haas is a weird choice - I found I had 5 influence left over and no real idea what to spend it on, so I took a chance. She works very well; behind an RSVP she can safely sit on the table for a turn and get a 3\/2 agenda scored for cheaper than a SanSan or a Biotic Labor. If you score an APP with her then you can replace her with another 3\/2 next turn and score it from hand, and now she's safely in archives. Alternatively, you can dare the runner into making a costly run to capture her, allowing you to set up for the rest of your game. If they don't run on her, woo, 4 clicks!<\/p>\n\n<p>Special mention goes to Snare - once the first Sweeps Week has been played runners will often operate on low hand-size to mitigate the bonus. When you combine that with reckless runs in an attempt to stop the first APP from getting scored, runners will often flatline or end their turn with a tag. (Closed Accounts punishes this mistake further, and is also an effective response to Tag-Me Siphon.) Archer and Flare have both pulled their weight as most runners don't see either coming - Flare is especially good against an early game Desperado, and Archer creates enough of a tempo swing to let you turn that sacrificed Breaking News into a scored 3\/2.<\/p>\n","username":"Circadia","cards":{"01070":2,"01081":3,"01082":2,"01084":1,"01090":1,"01092":2,"01096":1,"01101":1,"01110":3,"01111":2,"01113":2,"02056":2,"02114":1,"02115":3,"02117":1,"03010":1,"03023":2,"03026":1,"04014":1,"04015":2,"04020":1,"04034":1,"04040":2,"04059":2,"04076":3,"04077":2}},{"id":2213,"name":"Untitled","creation":"2014-02-13 08:59:45","description":"<p>This deck was born of my \"credit disparity\" style deck where I would use ash\/red herrings to put the runner into a spot where they either steal the agenda, and lost all their money, or they can't steal it and the astro train starts.

The beauties of using Kate are:\n- two in-faction stealth breakers (Dagger and Corroder) and in-faction Cloaks (which install for free with her discount)\n- lots of in-faction MU hardware to accommodate those Cloaks along with SMCs and the rest of her tools.\n- Astrolabe, Diesel, and Professional Contacts are in-faction<\/p>\n\n<p>Challenges to using this archetype:\n- MU is important and it&#039;s easy to paint yourself into a corner by pulling out a bunch of programs and not having room for a much-needed SMC.  Astrolabe and a single CyberSolutions Mem Chip brings you to 7 which should suffice most of the time.\n- Having enough Stealth credits is also obviously very important.  There&#039;s a single copy of Switchblade in the deck to make short work of Archer and whatnot, but it will eat your Stealth credits up in a hurry.  Ghost Runners should be kept for emergencies or big mutli-access digs.<\/p>\n\n<p>Potential Changes:\n- my first instinct is to ditch Paricia (which is mostly in to hate on NEH drip-econ decks) and replace it with 1x Diesel and 1x Ghost Runner.

[{"id":370,"name":"Psycho Gods","creation":"2013-11-02 03:23:22","description":"This is my attempt at a Custom Biotics deck. It works kinda like the Flytrap, in that it attempts to keep you tagged and locked by PSF, but it has a bunch of extra advantages. <br><br>One is that it can really steal the game under Tag-Me runners, by running and recursing psychographics. One combo is to simply use Efficiency Committee, Psychographics and Archived memories to score two agendas out of hand in one turn.<br><br>Another is, in case the runner has accumulated a decent number of tags, is to psychographics a Project Ares. It might make you poor, but if you hit the runner with a 9 counter Ares, when they don't expect it, it might give you precious time to rebuild or time to score PSF.<br><br>PSF + Efficiency Committee is also a nice combo. If you have those two scored and the runner is tagged, it's an instant kill unless they have meat damage protection. And even if they run caparace, you can just chip at it until it's gone, and flatline them the next round.<br><br>This deck in action: http:\/\/youtu.be\/ISgfSTvn-e4","username":"db0","cards":{"01056":3,"01058":3,"01064":3,"01084":1,"01085":2,"01087":1,"01104":3,"01107":3,"01109":3,"01110":3,"01113":2,"02052":2,"02080":2,"02092":3,"02110":2,"02116":2,"03002":1,"03005":3,"03015":1,"03019":1,"04010":3,"04015":3}},{"id":371,"name":"Kit aggro","creation":"2013-11-02 13:00:36","description":"","username":"djackman","cards":{"01008":3,"01012":3,"01026":1,"01034":3,"01035":3,"01038":2,"01050":3,"01051":2,"02009":2,"02047":2,"02066":1,"02087":2,"02091":3,"02107":2,"03028":1,"03038":2,"03044":3,"03046":3,"03052":3,"03053":2}},{"id":372,"name":"Kit aggro","creation":"2013-11-02 13:02:18","description":"","username":"djackman","cards":{"01008":3,"01012":3,"01026":1,"01034":3,"01035":3,"01038":2,"01050":3,"01051":2,"02009":2,"02047":1,"02066":1,"02087":2,"02091":3,"02107":3,"03028":1,"03038":2,"03044":3,"03046":3,"03052":3,"03053":2}},{"id":373,"name":"Whizzard Trash\/LeechEconomy","creation":"2013-11-02 13:13:20","description":"First deck using Whizzard, basically it aims at lowering corp's economy andtrashing cards\/ice using nerve agent, medium and parasite.

Me too.<\/p>\n\n<p>Your immediate goal with this deck should be scoring out an agenda as quickly as possible. Scoring Upgrades first is ideal, but any of the others is fine too. If it's Vitruvius, try to over-advance at least once: you'll want a Biotic Labor or Shipment from Sansan back later.\nAll the pressure is on the runner after you've scored just 1 agenda. Just keep padding your bank account and ICEing up R&amp;D, since that is where they'll beat you. Otherwise, score out whatever agendas you draw. Use Efficiency Committee tokens, Shipments, Biotic Labors and SanSans, and then use Reclamation Order or your Jacksons to get the cards you need back.\nAs a sidenote: I've actually never rezzed a <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01092\">SanSan City Grid<\/a> so far in testing. They've only really served as a tax for the runner, and I'm perfectly fine with that.<\/p>\n","username":"ImTheBanker","cards":{"01054":1,"01055":3,"01056":3,"01059":3,"01092":3,"01110":3,"02011":2,"02051":3,"02070":3,"02110":3,"03005":2,"04011":3,"04015":3,"04034":3,"04111":2,"04120":3,"05024":3,"06002":3,"06010":1}},{"id":7401,"name":"Noise \"V\" (Melbourne Regionals 2014 winner)","creation":"2014-07-06 01:20:05","description":"<p>Simply an updated version of this: <\/p>\n\n<p>http:\/\/netrunnerdb.com\/en\/decklist\/3267\/noise-v-goodgames-melbourne-store-championship-winner-<\/p>\n\n<p>I won't repeat the things I've said before but recently I have realised that there are three phases to my game plan.<\/p>\n\n<p>Phase 1: Aggression and luck<\/p>\n\n<p>The first few clicks of the game involves installing datasucker(s), face checking ice and running archives when it is unprotected - a lot of the time purely to build up sucker tokens - but also about 20% of the time you will see an agenda from the mill - that's the luck element.<\/p>\n\n<p>If the corp takes a mulligan, I give serious thought to mulliganing hard for a Medium. A lot of games are won from Medium digging an unprotected R&amp;D from turn 1.<\/p>\n\n<p>The plan is to keep the corp poor from rezzing ice and to put the pressure on right from the start if you get early points.<\/p>\n\n<p>My favourite starting play is: Sure Gamble, install Datasucker, run R&amp;D, Dirty Laundry archives. <\/p>\n\n<p>Phase 2: Control<\/p>\n\n<p>I think many people don't realise that the middle game for Noise is actually a control game. Crypsis + counters + A LOT of money is very threatening and this would be what I consider the optimum middle game state. Wherever the corp is not defending well - attack there. Once they start dedicating resources and time to making a big remote and advancing agendas - I probably won't be able to get in and that is the truth - but that is also the best time to attack R&amp;D or HQ. So really, it's all about diverting attention from where you're really planning to make a big run.<\/p>\n\n<p>Phase 3: Go hard or go home<\/p>\n\n<p>The late game (if you haven't won by now) will typically have very well defended servers and a corp beginning to turn the economy tide in their favour. As soon as they are on 5 points and threatening to score for the win, that is when I will start keeping tags, mass installing viruses and stimhacking servers like a mad man. Sometimes it's stimhacking a remote for the agenda, sometimes it's stimhacking for one last Medium dig, sometimes its installing multiple viruses then hitting archives. The most important thing to be able to do is to work out which server is most agenda-dense. That is the number one skill to have when playing Noise. This is Netrunner at its most fun and the most you will feel like you are truly playing as an Anarch.<\/p>\n\n<p>And one more thing - for Noise, the game is not in archives. The game is in HQ. Corps tend to try really hard to defend their archives and R&amp;D. They often leave their HQ poorly protected because they are not expecting me to run there. Agendas tend to accumulate in HQ because they are too afraid to try to advance them in remotes with Crypsis out. I win 50% of my games from single access HQ runs. Once Legwork came out - I had to put a copy of it in my deck. <\/p>\n\n<p>Also, realise that if you are not milling agendas then the only place for them to go is HQ and all their ice and economy has just been milled into archives, making it even harder to defend their agendas in HQ.<\/p>\n","username":"chanstheorem","cards":{"01001":1,"01002":2,"01004":2,"01006":3,"01008":3,"01010":3,"01012":3,"01050":3,"01051":3,"02003":3,"02022":3,"02091":2,"03038":3,"03052":3,"04043":3,"04109":2,"05033":3,"05035":1}},{"id":7402,"name":"NBN \"Morag\" (Melbourne Regionals 2014 winner)","creation":"2014-07-06 01:21:26","description":"<p>Simply an updated version of this:<\/p>\n\n<p>http:\/\/netrunnerdb.com\/en\/decklist\/3268\/nbn-morag-goodgames-melbourne-store-championship-winner-<\/p>\n\n<p>Fast Track means that the deck is now using Psychographics as the primary fast advance method with SanSan City Grid playing a smaller role.<\/p>\n\n<p>Eli, Viper and Draco remain kings.<\/p>\n","username":"chanstheorem","cards":{"01064":1,"01080":1,"01081":3,"01082":2,"01084":1,"01085":3,"01092":2,"01110":3,"02020":3,"02052":2,"02056":2,"02110":3,"02115":3,"02116":3,"04012":3,"04015":3,"04076":3,"04096":2,"04119":3,"04120":2,"05027":2}},{"id":7403,"name":"Ken the Prepaid Taxi","creation":"2014-07-06 01:29:15","description":"\n","username":"johncraven","cards":{"01007":1,"01018":3,"01022":3,"01024":3,"01026":1,"01036":1,"01050":3,"02007":1,"02009":2,"02043":2,"02091":1,"02104":3,"03035":1,"03052":3,"03054":3,"04004":1,"04029":3,"04065":1,"04109":3,"05029":1,"05033":3,"05035":1,"05036":1,"05055":1}},{"id":7404,"name":"Noise Blasting Shop","creation":"2014-07-06 02:01:13","description":"<p>Simple put together of my Noise deck, changed some things after testing it though.

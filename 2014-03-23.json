I went 2-2 with the deck there. One of the losses were to an Indexing\/Siphon Chaos Theory build much like my own runner deck, the other was just plain and simple bad luck (5 agendas left in 40 cards RnD, 3 of them were in the top 4 cards... gg). <\/p>\n\n<p>Yep, this is yet another Celebrity Imaging build. I feel like Blue-level Clearance massively helped the identity, with Subliminal Messaging possibly helping a ton as well (but I didn't manage to squeeze those in). Nothing super-shocking here, so I'll just give a short overview of how to play it and then cover the differences from other the various CI builds.<\/p>\n\n<p>What to mulligan for:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>1 piece of ICE and some playable econ (i.e. not Celeb Gift or Restructure)<\/li>\n<li>failing that, some econ and Blue\/Green Level Clearance (so you'll hopefully draw into ICE)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Your game plan is:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>ICE up HQ<\/li>\n<li>Draw up, farm up credits<\/li>\n<li>wait until you have Efficiency Commitee, 2 Biotic Labors and 12 credits to spare<\/li>\n<li>score EC from hand<\/li>\n<li>wait until you have Priority Requisition and 2 Shipments from SanSan in hand, score them with EC counters (bonus points if you get a free Wotan out of the deal)<\/li>\n<li>Grab one of the Biotics with Archived Memories, score Vitruvius out of hand... done.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>You most probably don't want to deviate from the plan at all, unless the runner is especially inept and you're flooded with ICE (yeah, right). The only remote I usually ever get is a Jackson that is going down to draw 4 cards and recur 3 econ operations afterwards. <\/p>\n\n<p>The one thing you need to always keep in mind: have a sufficient credit reserve that you don't have to discard if you get siphoned and have to rez all your ICE. Remember, your handsize is your best defense. <\/p>\n\n<p>The deck mostly plays itself, and is very resistant to economic pressure as well. You'll sometimes lose to random RnD accesses (and Indexing is your worst enemy), but if you manage to get most of your agendas into hand, you're solid. If you take it to a tournament, though, you need to take a really fast runner deck (like I did), otherwise you may very well end up going to time, which would be bad becase you usually don't have any points scored right up until the last 4 turns :)<\/p>\n\n<p>One thing that might seem weird is the single copy of Datapike and Rototurret. These are in so that I have one hard ETR of each type (well ok, the barrier one is Wotan, but still :P ). They always go on HQ, and they did work rather well in the tournament. <\/p>\n\n<p>The biggest difference between this CI build and the other most common one is agenda composition (and by extension, scoring plan). Most people I've seen are running just 1- and 2-pointers, aiming to either biotic out of hand, or possibly get a SanSan rezzed and rolling. I like my version better for 4 reasons:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>No remotes, less trashables<\/li>\n<li>Lower agenda density in RnD<\/li>\n<li>Possibly fewer credits to score out 7 points, depending on the amount of Shipments from SanSan involved<\/li>\n<li>FREE WOTAN!!!111!11!!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>After the tournament, I don't really feel like any changes are necessary. I'd really like to squeeze in 3x Subliminal Messaging, but I don't see anything to cut. The most likely candidates would probably be the Jacksons, actually... and they're still more useful than 3-5 free credits, as they'll net a whole lot of more by recurring Celebrity Gifts.<\/p>\n","username":"PeekaySK","cards":{"01058":3,"01059":3,"01062":3,"01064":1,"01106":3,"01110":3,"02051":3,"02070":3,"02110":3,"03001":1,"03005":3,"03019":3,"03027":1,"04012":3,"04015":3,"04030":2,"04034":3,"04040":3,"04090":3}},{"id":3382,"name":"Stealing ain't that hard (Vienna Store Champs First Place)","creation":"2014-03-23 05:20:05","description":"<p>So, this is the decklist I took first place with at the Damage Unlimited Store Championship in Vienna (2014\/03\/22). I went 4-0 with the deck there. <\/p>\n\n<p>I built the whole deck with one goal in mind: I wanted to be able to shutdown rush decks, with a particular emphasis on TWIY rush. NBN is definitely the strongest faction right now, and corp decks in general have sped up quite a bit in the last couple of data packs, to the point where runners have trouble keeping up. <\/p>\n\n<p>So, how do you stop a hardcore rush deck? After thinking about it for a while, I came to the conclusion that you need to, in no particular order:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>pressure HQ with Siphons<\/li>\n<li>pressure RnD with Indexing (and multi-access)<\/li>\n<li>be able to get into remotes quickly and reliably<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Now, obviously, Criminal can do all of this with a little outsourcing, but I don't like Criminal... and I've always been partial to a certain little girl we all know and love :) So, Shaper it is. Also, being Shaper means I get several important things I wouldn't get otherwise:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Magnum Opus for Closed Accounts recovery, meaning I can float tags mostly with impunity<\/li>\n<li>Program tutoring and recursion, as well as two awesome one-shot breakers<\/li>\n<li>Tinkering for guaranteed Siphons\/Indexings and remote runs into a server with ICE that is 2 pieces deep, with just a SMC and some money<\/li>\n<li>A modicum of cheap card draw<\/li>\n<li>Levy so I can go all night long with the siphoning and indexing if needed<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>The way to play this is pretty straightforward - pressure whenever you can, however you can. Siphon a couple of times so they go overboard on HQ protection, then switch to RnD assault with Indexing and Interfaces. Don't sit on large stacks of money unless you're certain they don't have Closed Accounts and\/or you actually need the cash reserve for something. Use Indexing either to set up multi-steal runs, or to move cards you really don't want them to have further down (in one game I actually delayed a Closed Accounts by about 15 draws, which got me enough time to get all set with breakers and MO, then I let my opponent have it since it didn't matter any more). <\/p>\n\n<p>What to mulligan for:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The best hands include both a Siphon and an Indexing... that way, unless the corp double-ices on their first turn, they're in for a world of hurt either way. And even if they do, you can usually do the Siphon, force the rez, and then either push through the indexing, or make them spend all their money stopping you. <\/li>\n<li>Failing that, you're looking for either Sure Gamble or Dirty Laundry - they're not a whole lot of burst econ in here, so getting some at start is important<\/li>\n<li>Failing that, it's ok to keep a hand of decent cards and none of the above, as long as there's a Diesel involved. You'll play it and probably get at least some of the parts you need. <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Some comments on card choices:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>One copy of Toolbox<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>I really can't describe how good CT's +1 memory is. Basically, it lets you do all sorts of nasty Clone Chip -> SMC hijinx even after you have a full set of breakers out. Having that flexibility means I can delay playing a console until I can afford the tempo hit... and Toolbox is awesome in here. Saves a bunch of money, gets me 3 memory (because Zu.13 suddenly costs 0), actually negates some ICE (I'm looking at you, Caduceus) and makes double-punitive plays more expensive to pull off. In the lategame, you can actually afford to have a spare SMC lying around for Power Shutdown protection, which is just awesome. <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>One copy of Magnum Opus<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>A.k.a. the money laundering machine. Pay it with stolen money and print some fresh credits on demand. Pull out with SMC as needed when you have 7 credits you don't immediately need. It becomes an awesome safety net and gives you a ton of flexibility. <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Femme as the only Killer<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>This is the part where I rave about how insanely good Sharpshooter is. What he does is let me delay playing the Femme until I actually have a bypass-worthy target. Also, breaking Archer for 2 is always fun. <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>One copy of Atman<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>This was the latest addition to the deck (the slot was originally a third SMC), but it definitely paid off. It got slotted, because I found that handling stacked copies of the same ICE repeatedly had the potential to become quite taxing (Eli, Archer and Viktor 2.0, I'm looking at you). A well-set Atman handles this problem nicely, and it also helps with handling Chimeras and Rototurrets. <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Zu.13 instead of Gordian Blade, especially in a deck with Tinkering<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>This is something I've mulled over, but in the end Zu turned out to be the right choice. It's much cheaper to get into play and eventually takes up 0 MU. The stacked code gate thing can become a problem, but these days if you encounter stacked code gates, they're usually copies of the same piece of ICE, so that will get covered by Atman.  <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Deus X<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Because dying to Snares is for losers. Also, breaks expensive ICE cheaply. One of the funniest moments of the tournament for me were when one of my opponents rezzed a Flare... at first I thought I'm boned, then I noticed that Flare is AP... Deus X, break, on we go :)<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>2 copies of RnD Interface, especially with so many other critical cards in the deck being one-ofs<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>I did try with one, but getting an Interface out is super-important for Indexing plays - you get a bit more leeway in how you order the opponent's cards and aren't totally reliant on guessing correctly whether he'll draw extra cards and how many. Once you get both out, you're pretty much set for RnD lock and don't have to run it every turn, leaving you free to do other things (like Siphons and the like). <\/p>\n\n<p>Finally, what I'd change after playing in the tournament:<\/p>\n\n<p>It felt like three Tinkerings were mostly overkill, I underestimated the amount of ICE-handling flexibility I built in here. I'll be dropping the third copy for a Chakana - it's a further way of pressuring RnD and stopping Fast Advance decks, so that's definitely worth it. God knows I have the memory for it :P<\/p>\n\n<p>UPDATE AFTER TESTING: the Chakana is brutal in this deck, definitely include it in place of the third Tinkering!<\/p>\n","username":"PeekaySK","cards":{"01007":1,"01018":3,"01026":1,"01034":3,"01037":3,"01041":1,"01044":1,"01050":3,"02007":1,"02009":3,"02046":1,"02066":1,"02106":3,"02107":2,"03035":1,"03038":3,"03040":1,"03046":2,"03052":3,"03054":3,"04067":1}},{"id":3383,"name":"Digi-paint me like one of your french cyborg-girls! v1.2","creation":"2014-03-23 06:43:35","description":"<p>Rielle \"Kit\" Peddler can be a very aggressive Runner, but once the Corp has more levels of ICE protecting the servers, things can become difficult.<\/p>\n\n<p>Tinkering and Paintbrush can basically allow you to keep going with only a Decoder, and Torch seems the better option to save a ton of money in the long run.<\/p>\n\n<p>Omega can break anything in the innermost level and while it might get expensive, it means that even with just 2 Icebreakers installed you can pass wherever you want, unless the Corp ices up to 3 levels.<\/p>\n\n<p>To make things even easier, the chivalrous Knight comes to help the cyber-damsel in distress.

As I've told many others, GRNDL screams \"I'm doing bad things, and must hide them!\" and just revels in the bad publicity that it generates.  In my build, I've decided that if I were to run the show at GRNDL, then I'd want to be a lot more proactive about things.  I admit that I've poached ideas from other people's builds to assemble this specialist in Wet Work.<\/p>\n\n<p>GRNDL Wet Works is a hybrid AP and Flatline deck.  She is just as happy at scoring Agendas while the Runner cowers in fear, or flatlining the fearless Runner.<\/p>\n\n<p>Blackmail has been mentioned, but is really just a Phase 2 threat against the monster's that GRNDL Wet Works intends to build and can lead to the overconfidence that ends with a SEA Source into Scorched Earth ending.<\/p>\n\n<p>ECONOMY:<\/p>\n\n<p>GRNDL's ID starts with 10 credits and 1 bad publicity, a significant 5 click advantage over the Runner that so far is only matched by Andromeda's 4 click starting hand advantage.  GRNDL economy starts big, and we are playing to keep it big.  Hedge Fund and Restructure help leverage that 10 credit start into higher budgets, but it's Geothermal Fracking and Profiteering that will really return a profit to us.  GRNDL Refinery also has the potential to give us some profit, but it's primary role is a Phase 2 or 3 lure to tempt the Runner into wasting clicks and credits in the hopes of finding an Agenda.  <\/p>\n\n<p>AGENDA:<\/p>\n\n<p>GRNDL Wet Works wants to show off exactly how badly she can wreck your day if you come snooping, and runs lean on Agends.  Geothermal Fracking and Profiteering pile up the bad publicity in exchange for some significant Economy pop, with Geothermal Fracking providing emergency funds in case an Account Siphon manages to make it's way into HQ.  Executive Retreat provides a hand refill while recycling Agenda overloads back into R&amp;D.  The Cleaners takes our dangerous meat damage factory and cranks the intensity up a notch each time.  While there is room to shrink the Agenda density even further, the cost would be vital components to our economy.<\/p>\n\n<p>ASSET:<\/p>\n\n<p>GRNDL Wet Works is a study in contrasts.  She intends to build 1-2 protected servers for her Agendas, but she also has plans for building a forest of servers to confuse the Runner with.  If possible, the first unprotected server should be a Snare! to catch the Runner off guard and scare them into slower game play.  No one expects Wayland to be playing traps, and that first Snare! will throw off their tempo.  Once Snare! lands, start dropping Dedicated Response Teams and Jackson Howard outside of the deep ICE.  Worst case scenario, the Runner accesses them and dedicates 3 credits a piece to remove them.  Best case scenario, the Runner is aware that we have DRT in play but can't remove them, and will grow even more cautious in their tempo.<\/p>\n\n<p>UPGRADE:<\/p>\n\n<p>Off the Grid is a speed bump that can buy a turn to score an Agenda against the Runner by forcing them to waste credits and a click on HQ.  With proper planning, an early Off the Grid can be coupled with an iceberg HQ to truly ruin the Runner's day.<\/p>\n\n<p>OPERATIONS:<\/p>\n\n<p>Wet Works is an euphemism for the kind of brutality that this GRNDL wants to give to the Runner, and the non-economy Operations are focused on this.  SEA Source is a famous tag source against the cautious Runner, and Scorched Earth is the current king of meat damage.  If The Cleaners is scored, then the Runner must keep a full hand of 5 cards or face a Scorched Earth flatline.<\/p>\n\n<p>ICE:<\/p>\n\n<p>GRNDL Wet Works has the economy to play with big time ICE, but her influence is too low and her clicks too precious to play with the riff-raff ICE.  She has assembled an elite entourage to accompany her into battle against the Runner, starting with Guard to stop those Criminal minded Runners from worming into her accounts.  Archer is a staple, and Swarm has the potential with Wet Work's economy to wreck a Runner's rig especially since Swarm can be grown to fit the Runner's capabilities.  Hadrian's Wall is primarily for R&amp;D and your Agenda server, as Hadrian starts with a significant strength in addition to growth capability.  Ireress is a nasty little minx that will ensure the Runner must spend clicks and credits to dig out Yog.0 before crossing Ireress.  The real star here is Draco.  Draco does not require any clicks to advance his strength, but no one currently expects to face a 9+ strength sentry that Wet Works will turn Draco into.  With the capability of giving a tag as well as end the run, Draco will ensure that the Runner leaves the run with only lost clicks and credits.<\/p>\n\n<p>FUTURE:\nGRNDL Wet Works is flirting with both Cerebral Cast and Inazumi.  If Jackson's capability do not prove themselves in playtest, then he'll find himself on the streets in favor of those two.  GRNDL Refinery is a strategy that can be increased if Blackmail is heavy in the local meta to give more non-Agenda targets to waste those 3 Blackmail runs on, as well as Plan B if Blackmail really takes off in your meta.<\/p>\n","username":"bubo","cards":{"01070":2,"01086":2,"01099":3,"01101":2,"01102":3,"01110":3,"02020":3,"02039":2,"02118":2,"04015":2,"04017":3,"04018":2,"04036":2,"04038":2,"04039":3,"04040":3,"04057":3,"04097":1,"04099":2,"05024":2}},{"id":3397,"name":"NBN: Gossip Rag","creation":"2014-03-23 16:50:18","description":"<p>6 out of 11 agendas are 2 points to the runner, 3+ points to the corp when scored with Psychographics (usually in one turn after a midseasons tag drop).<\/p>\n\n<p>The ice is all designed to be taxing, and increase your income gap with the runner.  Even Marked Accounts help with this, either they are trickle economy for the corp or they cost the runner 5 to trash, making it that much easier to score a big Midseasons => Psychographics when they eventually steal an agenda.<\/p>\n\n<p>Big risks to the deck are an Atman at 4 strength, or a rabbit hole.  <\/p>\n\n<p>But since you don't need any remotes, you can concentrate all the ice on the centrals.

[{"id":5706,"name":"Reinman v1.1 - Atman in Anarch","creation":"2014-05-18 00:10:22","description":"<p>I've never played an Atman deck, and I wanted to give it a try. Rather than do the normal Shaper version, I thought I'd give an Anarch version a try, given that that's where most of the support comes from, and it's my preferred faction. So far, it's going rather well. I'm able to put on a lot of early pressure thanks to the versatile breaker suite, and the potential for a lot of ICE destruction.<\/p>\n\n<p>Notes on cards:<\/p>\n\n<p>-Logos solves a lot of Anarch's consistency problems, to the point where I increased it from 2x. It might be overkill, but those tutors are great. <\/p>\n\n<p>-Masanori is an untested addition in this version. I wanted card draw, so I'm giving him a whirl. He replaced 2x Bishop, which were there to keep higher ICE in Atman range. They may still be worth it, but I'm not convinced based on the decks I tried it against.<\/p>\n\n<p>-Keyhole is amazing. <\/p>\n\n<p>-Mimic for Swordsman.<\/p>\n\n<p>-Djinn solves MU problems, mostly. Also tutors the 1x viruses.<\/p>\n\n<p>Potential changes:<\/p>\n\n<p>-Someone suggested 2x Atman and 1x Test Run. I'm considering giving it a whirl.<\/p>\n\n<p>-The third Logos could be dropped, either for a Scavenge or 2x Quality Time. Scav is great with Atman, and QT addresses the lack of draw.<\/p>\n\n<p>-Seriously, card draw. Anarch. Ugh.<\/p>\n\n<p>I'm really liking where this deck is going, so any suggestions are greatly appreciated.<\/p>\n","username":"Thike","cards":{"01002":3,"01004":1,"01005":3,"01008":3,"01009":2,"01010":1,"01011":2,"01012":3,"01050":3,"01053":3,"02022":2,"02041":1,"02091":3,"02101":2,"03040":3,"04009":2,"04041":1,"04043":3,"04061":2,"05037":3}},{"id":5707,"name":"J:RP Glacier, Vagabond 2014-05-18","creation":"2014-05-18 01:08:10","description":"<p>This is the corp deck I ran at the Vagabond store champs in Auckland.

The decks annoys the runner by making everything so expensive that it's impossible to run every turn.<\/p>\n\n<p>You should put your most taxing ICE on centrals, so that the runner is forced to either pay a lot or get really hurt, so you get scoring windows for your agendas. You're also trying to make the runner poor by making him pay a lot trash your resources (which he can get to only after running centrals).<\/p>\n\n<p>Now the agendas.Since almost all of your agendas force the runner to pay for them, they need lots of money to run, because they need to pay for your ICE first, and then they need to have enough money to steal your agendas, so you use that time to score before they have enough money to run.<\/p>\n\n<p>The net damage is just to stall the runner and hopefully get key cards from their hands, not to get a flatline. Shi kyu is ther instead of shock to protect your archives.<\/p>\n\n<p>I think there's a lot of room for improvement, but I'm still testing the deck, so any suggestions are appreciated in the comments.<\/p>\n","username":"w1kk","cards":{"01062":1,"01068":3,"01070":2,"01075":2,"01077":2,"01090":2,"01109":3,"01110":3,"02013":2,"02029":3,"02031":1,"02032":2,"02060":2,"04015":2,"04033":1,"04054":3,"04060":2,"04074":2,"04093":1,"04114":2,"04119":2,"04120":1,"05007":2,"05011":2,"05018":2}},{"id":5748,"name":"Please don't play Bug!

Katman has started showing up in my meta so I've reworked the ICE for more variety and a swordsman.

Even here, I \"could\" win via scoring agendas but I rather just smother the runner with meat damage. \nOnly seven total agenda cards are in the deck. This allows the deck to support the addition of 2 Pad Campaigns for economy. Snares are there for the net damage annoyance and tagging. Sea Source is there if I want to force a Scorched Earth. And of course can't forget about Punitive Counter Strike for punishing the running for scoring agendas. <\/p>\n\n<p>For ICE, 2 Draco to hold up against Account Siphon runs. 2 Grims to act as outer layers of ICE to trash programs, Taurus to destroy hardware and Hadrian's Wall is the big thick piece of ice the deck(just in case).

This gave me a NEXT suite with some extra tagging and a little program trashing (1x each of <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01101\">Archer<\/a>, <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01062\">Ichi 1.0<\/a>, and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01064\">Rototurret<\/a>). The idea here is to use the cheap NEXT ETR ice to score a little early to force the runner to not sit around and credit-up, and gives you another potential win condition rather than just sitting back and tagging.<\/p>\n","username":"vampire0","cards":{"01058":2,"01062":1,"01064":1,"01085":2,"01101":1,"01106":3,"01110":3,"01112":2,"02051":2,"02052":2,"02070":3,"02092":3,"02116":3,"03002":1,"03023":1,"03026":1,"04011":3,"04015":2,"04040":2,"04100":2,"04119":3,"06001":3,"06002":3,"06010":1}},{"id":8050,"name":"Harmony Medtech: Stone Memorial Wing v.01","creation":"2014-07-29 12:29:42","description":"<p>A very basic Medtech shell game deck using 5\/3 agendas.

Snares are to protects R&amp;D and your hand, Shi Kyu your hand and archives (also, they mean the runner needs 3 agendas to win) and shocks protect R&amp;D and archives.\nRonin is there to threaten the flatline, and because when they see it, then everything is potentialy deadly, so they can't just leave your advanced assets there. Cerebral is to use those mistakes to make the runner miserable.\nZaibatsu is a necesary evil in this deck because you can't have your assets exposed.\nThe ICE is to make things as taxing as possible for the runner on R&amp;D, which is probably the only place where they will find agendas (jackson helps with your hand and archives). The chimeras are there to stop those pesky siphons from getting to you until they have a full rig.

What I've learned is that this deck is subtle in its strength and variable in its function. It's a complex brand of HB Glacier, with an emphasis on providing the opportunity to suddenly take control of the field.<\/p>\n\n<p>{Agenda Choices &amp; Functionality}<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"\/en\/card\/03005\">Efficiency Committee<\/a> is used as utility, with potential synergy with <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01107\">Private Security Force<\/a>, which is used to kill if you can, harass if you can't (assuming the tag, of course).\n<a href=\"\/en\/card\/01108\">Melange Mining Corp.<\/a> and Efficiency Committee can also be used in conjunction to net 14 credits with 6 total clicks in a single turn (using all tokens from <a href=\"\/en\/card\/03005\">Efficiency Committee<\/a>). <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01108\">Melange Mining Corp.<\/a> also functions well if there's a <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02011\">Mandatory Upgrades<\/a> or two scored. <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01106\">Priority Requisition<\/a> is generally scored last and if not, second, with the intent to rez any high-cost ice.<\/p>\n\n<p>{Control Choices &amp; Functionality}<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"\/en\/card\/01057\">Aggressive Secretary<\/a> is installed and advanced 2-4 times, depending on how many Mandatory Upgrades are scored. This is often done late game, when 4-6 points are scored and the Runner is feeling pressured.<\/p>\n\n<p>As the Runner gets more desperate to score the last point or gain an edge in the spread, they inevitably gain a tag or two or incur a power counter on <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01088\">Data Raven<\/a>. Giving a tag to the runner can trash a troublesome resource (Donut is especially problematic), empty their credit pool with <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01084\">Closed Accounts<\/a>, or trash two programs with <a href=\"\/en\/card\/06012\">Bad Times<\/a> in the late-game when the Runner has their full rig.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"\/en\/card\/04058\">Power Shutdown<\/a> for 0 or 1 eats Self-Modifying Code and Datasucker, which can put quite the damper on the Runner. Sometimes a Power Shutdown for 2 is appropriate, but only if it can get rid of a troubling program\/hardware. It may be appropriate to go higher, but that isn't necessarily advised.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"\/en\/card\/04019\">Cyberdex Trial<\/a> has quite a bit of utility, protecting you from a wide range of viruses at the cost of only one click. It's surprisingly good and can stall well if the Runner leans on viruses at all.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"\/en\/card\/02013\">Ash 2X3ZB9CY<\/a> is amazing in the mid to late-game, when pushing through a remote is becoming expensive. It forces the Runner to make two expensive runs to score an agenda or trash a vital resource.<\/p>\n\n<p>{Recursion Engine}<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"\/en\/card\/04111\">Reclamation Order<\/a> and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01058\">Archived Memories<\/a> allows for a near-endless recursion of economy, control cards, and the occasional piece of discarded or trashed ICE. While it's click-heavy and a little slow, it's somewhat off-set by <a href=\"\/en\/card\/03005\">Efficiency Committee<\/a> and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02011\">Mandatory Upgrades<\/a>. But being able to recur the economy cards is the backbone of the large hand size that CI is notorious for.<\/p>\n\n<p>{ICE Choices}<\/p>\n\n<p>The ICE spread has been changed more than anything else. While 15 may seem like a low number, it's actually more than adequate. <a href=\"\/en\/card\/03024\">Levy University<\/a> may seem awkward at first, but it's the key to getting what you need, when you need it. As there's a lot of ICE variation, getting that important piece of ICE may be troublesome, but the variation serves an important function. Unpredictability. While that's a double-edged sword, it makes the Runner more cautious or more easily controlled. Both of which are a benefit.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"\/en\/card\/04117\">Hive<\/a>, <a href=\"\/en\/card\/06010\">Mother Goddess<\/a>, <a href=\"\/en\/card\/06003\">Lotus Field<\/a>, and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01064\">Rototurret<\/a> are great ice for slipping through an early game agenda, preferably a Mandatory Upgrades.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"\/en\/card\/02060\">Chimera<\/a> is great to keep the Runner out of R&amp;D early on, but it's hard to keep funded in the long-run and should eventually be abandoned. Chimera also doesn't interfere with Mother Goddess, making it shine if both are obtained early enough.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"\/en\/card\/01088\">Data Raven<\/a> is placed where the Runner is most likely to run the most, increasing the chances for that vital tag later.<\/p>\n\n<p>Another awesome card from Upstalk, <a href=\"\/en\/card\/06009\">Taurus<\/a> is guaranteed to trash a piece of hardware for 3 credits (8 if freshly rez'd), if the Runner allows the trace to go off. Getting rid of a vital console can seriously cripple or hinder the Runner.<\/p>\n\n<p>I'm a little iffy on <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02030\">Sherlock 1.0<\/a>, but he appears to be good taxing ICE. If it turns out that he doesn't work as an inclusion, I may give <a href=\"\/en\/card\/03018\">Minelayer<\/a> or <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01103\">Ice Wall<\/a> a shot.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"\/en\/card\/02020\">Drac\u014d<\/a> has a nice tag function and offers a good amount of hate against Atman and Datasucker tricks, as does <a href=\"\/en\/card\/06003\">Lotus Field<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>The rest of the ice are simply to tax or impede the Runner.<\/p>\n","username":"Wrathrage","cards":{"01057":1,"01058":3,"01061":1,"01064":1,"01084":1,"01088":1,"01090":1,"01106":3,"01107":1,"01108":3,"01110":3,"02011":3,"02013":1,"02020":1,"02030":1,"02060":1,"02110":2,"03001":1,"03005":2,"03024":2,"04015":3,"04019":1,"04030":1,"04040":3,"04058":1,"04111":2,"04117":1,"06003":1,"06009":1,"06010":2,"06012":1}},{"id":7696,"name":"The Stirling Files","creation":"2014-07-17 23:40:06","description":"<p>I've been fooling around with a Blackmail-centered deck for a long while now; first with Andy, and then with the old man. I know it's safer to use the combination of Activist Support, Aesop's and something to dodge the tag; but it's also pretty boring and un-interactive.\nSo this is the other way; I even ditched the Notoriety's to release some influence and get some more thrill out of it.<\/p>\n\n<p>Early game is some aggresion and mostly setup: Hostage into Mr. Li ASAP, set breakers, get Logos up, put some pressure but avoiding the big risks. There's no point in showing R&amp;D or Frame Job until everything is up; since most Corps tend to believe you'll pressure HQ the most (let them).\nSome of that effort should yield an agenda, but most of the time the Corp scores more so Iain's ability kicks in. \nOnce the rig is set (hopefully) the Corp gets trapped between relentless R&amp;D digging and the tears of knowing any remote is obscenely accesible through cycling Blackmails. You need to trash SanSans, time The Source well, and sometimes race between R&amp;D digs and Fast Advance... <\/p>\n\n<p>So, you know, it's clunky and strange, it doesn't even work 50% of the time... But it's been fun to create it, and to learn to pilot it; so here it is, naked in the public view.

His comments about the deck follow:<\/p>\n\n<p>For those that follow the show, you already know I have been a dedicated Shaper player from the start and someone that places heavy value on creative yet still strong\/competitive deck builds. The current card pool, I believe, is still deep enough that there are decks and combos here that have yet to be discovered. I would spend so much time just looking at all the cards that were coming out in faction(Shaper) that were being ignored. Trying to figure out the threads that tie them together and the synergy of the combined results. Shaper\u2019s are by nature the Rig Builder faction. So what I wanted to do was build the most effective and powerful rig as cheaply as I could. All the tools I needed were available, I just have to piece it together.<\/p>\n\n<p>This build has gone through numerous renditions and small changes over the last few months. It lacked ability to apply early pressure and although the wrong opening hand can still cause this, I have added in some tools to aid in those early game turns. It also took me a while to come to terms with cutting the \u201cnew hotness\u201d out of my decks. I sat down with recent tournament winner Seth Stewart after his win to talk deck ideas and he helped set me straight on a few points and the changes I would make to my build before I entered the tournament, that I would go on to win.<\/p>\n\n<p>The hardest part in building a runner deck is my personal preference, I don\u2019t like to go above the minimum. If it says 45 I build for 45. There are cards I need to see and anything more messes with my changes to see them. Runners have a lot of cool toys and tricks to play but when it boils down if it didn\u2019t fit the core theme I took it out. Lets look at what we have here.<\/p>\n\n<p>Programs - The best standard (no trash to use - example Faerie or DeusX) breaker set of I could come up with combines Morning Star, Torch, and Garrote. Boom! With this combo I can eat through everything out there for really low cost. It was great busting through Double Eli\u2019s for 2 credits stealing an agenda corp thought was safe. There is no denying  that this is a strong pairing or programs but using these raise 3 issues. Memory to install ( full set is 5MU), Morning Star is a fixed strength breaker, and most important cost ( this we will talk about last since its the key to the deck).<\/p>\n\n<p>Hardware - Lets get this out the way, as much as I hate using Plascrete, as it becomes a dead draw against non meat damage decks it really is a must include in tournaments. Before the last pack I was using Public Sympathy since it was an ability that I could always use.The extra hand size was nice and if they tried to hit me with meat damage I just took the damage as my hand size could afford it. The down side now is that EVERYONE is using NBN so you will see Sweeps Week played. I\u2019m not letting anyone get 10 credit swing on me for the cost of 1 credit. So Plascrete went in. Two of my main issues with my programs needed to get corrected with Hardware. The MU was easy; since all I need is 1 more slot 3 copies of Akamatsu are used. Free install with Mac\u2019s ability, and the 3 copies because I need 1 and that helps me come across it quicker. Early version of this deck used Dinosaurus to give Morning Star the strength boost it needed for those higher barriers. This proved to be really slow on the set up since as you will see timing is everything with this deck. Like a Yog + Dinosaurus you want to see the Dino first and get that installed then the breaker hosted on it. This was great since it tackled memory issue and strength but it was too slow on set up for me. If I don\u2019t see the Dino I could very well be in trouble and then I cant even install the barrier breaker for the ICE that it doesn\u2019t need the boost for. Answer was Personal Touch. Letting me install the breaker and boost strength later on. This also worked well because when I see what they are playing and didn\u2019t need the boost on the Morning Star I could allocate it to a different program making cost to use lower. I do realize this was a gamble since even a 8 strength Morning Star could be stopped by Wotan, potential outer most Curtain Wall and some tricks to add strength value to an ICE but I played the chances I wasn\u2019t going to encounter any of this. Again Mac\u2019s ability saves you money here so you can spend credits on what you really want to spend them on - making runs.<\/p>\n\n<p>All the Rest - Alright so the third problem I talked about, the cost of the breakers. How do we off set that. We want to install everything for 3 credits each.<\/p>\n\n<p>These are the install combos:<\/p>\n\n<p>Test Run out a program then Scavenge it so it is in play permanently<\/p>\n\n<p>Test Run a program then end of turn its on top of stack so you can use Eureka!<\/p>\n\n<p>Motivation at turn start, see its a program, Eureka!<\/p>\n\n<p>Now Motivation is definitely not really needed but you could get lucky and save on a Test Run. <\/p>\n\n<p>Motivation is really in there because this deck will be set for the release of Oracle May, (http:\/\/onosendaicorp.com\/cards\/runner\/card\/oracle-may?faction=N ) tell me that wont be great. In case you are not seeing multiple copies of Test Run, Eureka! or Scavenge you have Same Old Thing that can double as anyone of those, ready to bail you out of trouble. <\/p>\n\n<p>I don\u2019t use Clone Chips or Self-Modifying Code as searchers since that would cost too much. We don\u2019t want to pay full breaker price. That defeats the deck style. Professional Contacts is expensive to play and sometimes if you have Motivation in play you don\u2019t want to be drawing that much. There is always going to be times in a card game when you just are not getting what you need. Buckle down and deep dig with Quality Time. Don\u2019t be afraid to discard the programs if you draw one of them, Test Run works also by pulling from the Heap.<\/p>\n\n<p>I did talk about slow setup and this is where the idea from my buddy Seth came in. Account Siphon. 9 times out of 10 it is catching someone off guard playing this out of faction. We also have recurrence of it with Same Old Thing if you need to really drop punishment. You wont see someone hole up HQ as tight as they do R&amp;D against a Shaper. And everyone knows early Siphon sets the corps plans back a turn and a bit. So I made some adjustments and added 2 copies of it in. Pure Punishment!<\/p>\n\n<p>Nothing is better than that extra click when you need it. The surprise install with Eureka burns an extra click as a cost so I included 2 All-nighter\u2019s. Helping you make an extra well timed run. Add in some standard economy cards and you have a deck.<\/p>\n\n<p>But whats one more little mind game - Woman In the Red Dress. This card is amazing. It has the corp making choices he never thought he would have to make. It can save you from spending credits on an R&amp;D run if the card is not drawn and also helps you see where agendas are. Its just a great icing on tasty piece of cake. I think that about covers everything. Really hope you enjoyed this write up.

Keep your hand full instead of running <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02009\">Plascrete Carapace<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>Finally, when your milling is complete\/enough, or when you think the corp is getting close to winning, use your <a href=\"\/en\/card\/06059\">Hades Shard<\/a> for the ultimate frustration win.  When it works, it's so awesome that you might even feel guilty.  This will also get WAY better once <a href=\"\/en\/card\/07051\">Stim Dealer<\/a> is released!<\/p>\n\n<p>Have fun with it, and feel free to comment and make suggestions!<\/p>\n","username":"greylin","cards":{"01001":1,"01002":3,"01006":2,"01007":1,"01008":2,"01009":2,"01011":1,"01012":2,"01014":1,"01047":2,"01050":3,"02003":2,"02091":2,"02101":2,"02102":1,"03038":3,"03054":3,"04043":2,"05051":3,"06037":3,"06054":3,"06059":1,"06060":1,"06074":3}},{"id":9915,"name":"Drawn together v4","creation":"2014-10-18 23:14:44","description":"<p>Mulligan for a card draw card.

Between his natural mill ability (with the 18 [!] viruses in this deck), the re-mill abilities inherent in 2x <a href=\"\/en\/card\/03035\">Levy AR Lab Access<\/a> and 2x <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01002\">D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu<\/a>, I feel like most corp's will feel this is a one-trick pony.  However, it also has eco (most particularly via the suggestion of <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01047\">Aesop's Pawnshop<\/a> + <a href=\"\/en\/card\/06037\">Cache<\/a> + <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01006\">Grimoire<\/a> and the ineffable <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01050\">Sure Gamble<\/a>.

I did this by changing a full-breaker suite for 2x Crypsis (who is himself a virus!). Since you'll most likely have plenty of money, the pay difference isn't so bad.  Other changes are dropping some <a href=\"\/en\/card\/03047\">Sahasrara<\/a> for 3x <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01005\">Cyberfeeder<\/a>. This is (most likely) a drop in instal eco, but saves me influence and increases the ability to run.

I had been playing the 'HB Brainbuster' deck for a while, but found that it's seeming slow-burn up to brutal econ strength was going underutilized in the mid game. So I decided to strip back all the efforts to flatline the runner, maintain the focus on econ, and try and use that econ to facilitate fast advances, as well as situations where you can simply buy the runner out of runs, as is the case with <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02052\">Viper<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now time to test it out and see how it goes.<\/p>\n","username":"custron","cards":{"01054":1,"01055":3,"01056":3,"01061":2,"01062":2,"01092":3,"01106":1,"01110":3,"01113":2,"02011":1,"02034":2,"02051":3,"02052":2,"02092":3,"02110":3,"03004":1,"03009":3,"03016":2,"03019":2,"03022":3,"03026":2,"04015":2,"04039":2,"04050":1,"04100":1,"04119":2,"04120":2,"05016":1}},{"id":9083,"name":"Shaped Chaos","creation":"2014-08-30 11:31:06","description":"<p>Chaos:\nnoun\n1.\na state of utter confusion or disorder; a total lack of organization or order.<\/p>\n\n<p>What if we could shape a state of disorder? A puzzle piece that could fit with jagged edges where it should be smooth. That's exactly what this deck is trying to do.<\/p>\n\n<p>This deck is fast and organized Chaos, fitting of the ID. <\/p>\n\n<p>Set the pace early, either with econ, running, or draw power. An ideal starting hand will have a <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01044\">Magnum Opus<\/a> or a <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01050\">Sure Gamble<\/a>, a <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01035\">Modded<\/a>, A <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01034\">Diesel<\/a>, and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/03034\">Scavenge<\/a>.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Almost any hand will have at least 2 of the 5(6) choices. Honestly you should only be using a mulligan if you're overloaded with Hardware and programs that aren't MO. <\/p>\n\n<p>Some fast first turn plays you can use are: Install Magnum, click for 6 credits. Sets the pace of econ quickly, nothing funnier than watching a corp not know what to do with 2 unrezzed ice over HQ and R&amp;D, staring as you install your main econ card and take 6 credits from it on turn 1. <\/p>\n\n<p>Next play: Anything using Test Run\/ Scavenge. Use it for a Magnum if you don't have a sure gamble in your hand. Use Sure Gamble, Test Run for a Fem, put it's counter on R&amp;D, run R&amp;D, and then Scavenge it to keep it in play, putting it's counter on the ice in front of HQ. Confuse the corp into icing what servers you want them to ice. Early Fem gives you access to almost any server turn 1.<\/p>\n\n<p>Other possible plays? Diesel a bunch, toss all your programs in the heap. \"Why would you do this?!\" You may ask, and I'll tell you why. In this deck, Programs are almost useless in your grip. (the only time they aren't useless is when you have a modded or you for some reason want to hard rez one of these huge ice breakers\/MO). All of your tutoring is either from your Stack or your Heap. In fact, your most reliable form of gathering your programs is probably going to be your heap. Because you won't really have the opportunity to draw a program from your heap. You can Test run\/Scavenge it, you can Retrieval Run it, and you can just you know, Same Old Thing into a Test Run\/Scavenge if you are really desperate. You will only need to get things 4 times if done correctly, and the rest (hardware) can be modded out.<\/p>\n\n<p>Alright some choices here that may be confusing that I'd like to clarify. <\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"\/en\/card\/06038\">Net Celebrity<\/a> and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/06036\">Unscheduled Maintenance<\/a>. Currently I'm only running 1 Unscheduled because of influence, but I'm thinking of taking my 2nd fem out and putting another in here. Here's why: First of all, trying to play this deck without a current is suicide, as if any corp is running Enhanced Login Protocol, you are literally boned harder than Dinosaurus' Fossils. With the only way to get that out of play is to steal an agenda, most likely by the time you get one, another ELP will come out the next turn, and you're boned again. <\/p>\n\n<p>This may be a meta call, but I prefer to be safe on all sides here, and I'd take <a href=\"\/en\/card\/06036\">Unscheduled Maintenance<\/a> over <a href=\"\/en\/card\/06038\">Net Celebrity<\/a>, just because of a better meshing with this deck. Sure you have huge ice breakers, but if they can only install 1 ice per turn, then they're going to fall behind in their ability to protect things, which means you can fem them and make them cry. Keep in mind, these are mostly here just because of my Current heavy local meta, but it's good to keep at least 2 in deck no matter what. I'm keeping 3 because I know guys will throw down 3 ELP's no problem. <\/p>\n\n<p>HQ\/R&amp;D Int are pretty self-explained, multi access is better than single access, especially if you can modded both of them out for 1 credit a piece. <\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"\/en\/card\/03037\">Feedback Filter<\/a> and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01045\">Net Shield<\/a>. These are very very local meta picks because there is this guy who runs like.. 4 ice Jinteki PE with a ton of assets that deal tons of net damage and Flatlines everyone. And then we have some HB players too, so that kind of messes things up. Net Shield I would say is just a great pick in any deck (only a 1fer though) just as an option against Jinteki. Taking too much Net Damage? Throw down a Net Shield and take the 1credit cost to take away 1 net damage. <\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"\/en\/card\/03049\">Professional Contacts<\/a>. If you mulligan into a bad hand, you can get boned pretty quickly with bad card draw. This prevents that by making every draw much more efficient, because hey, money. Also it's a very viable option against 4ice Jinteki PE who keeps on making you take net damage and spend your money to trash assets and steal his agendas. <\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"\/en\/card\/03044\">Cyber-Cypher<\/a>. Not too sure why I even have this in here, haven't played it once. But I still think it's a really good safety net. Don't have enough to modded out a Torch? No worries, Cyber Cypher that server you're focusing your hate on because screw that server in particular. <\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"\/en\/card\/02004\">Morning Star<\/a>. Best Breaker for Dinosaurus in this deck, just plop it on and laugh at everyone's less than 7 strength barriers, if you're against weyland, just switch your fem to whatever hadrians they're advancing to stop it and laugh at them more. (This is also why I'm keeping a second fem, just incase of this scenario so I can have 2 fems out to be like 'Yo your stupid curtain wall is useless now that you somehow got out as the fourth piece of ice on your advancing remote and hard rezzed because you're Weyland.' )<\/p>\n\n<p>The main problem this deck runs into is if you have to make choices on what breakers to Test\/Scav out, in that case, just facecheck. Worst case scenario, you lose a magnum, take brain damage and die... okay that's actually kind of bad. But early game I doubt they'll have anything like that.. (hopefully). So you can just facecheck early to see what kind of ice they're running and base that on if you think they'd have multiples of that ice. So just be like 'Yo nice Elis you have there, shame if a Morning Star were to happen to it.' <\/p>\n\n<p>I am currently negative with this deck. (not this rendition of it; I haven't got to test my tweaks yet (namely adding more recursion and adding pro contacts for those times I was digging for nothing because I was stupid and thought 'Eh i'll try out how it does with a bad hand' instead of taking a mulligan...) But it was a bunch of me misplaying and the deck STILL almost made up for an idiot like me running it, (I had 2 games where I had 6 points on the board and FLATLINE : (, the other I stole 5 agenda the first 2 turns and then Near Earth Hub just kinda.. Astrochained to victory because I didn't get a magnum out fast enough. Like I said, bad plays by me, deck still almost made up for it. )<\/p>\n\n<p>This was inspired by  Dinomite v3 (and v2\/v1 respectively.) With my own meta twists and personal preferences on it. I hope you enjoy it, if you have any questions please ask and I can let you know!<\/p>\n","username":"masunrays","cards":{"01004":1,"01026":2,"01034":3,"01035":3,"01044":3,"01045":1,"01050":3,"02004":1,"02046":1,"02047":3,"02048":2,"02085":1,"02101":2,"02107":1,"03034":3,"03035":1,"03037":1,"03044":1,"03049":1,"03054":3,"04047":1,"06036":1,"06038":2}},{"id":9084,"name":"Nasirs Toolbox 0.5","creation":"2014-08-30 12:24:25","description":"<p>Use SMCs and Workshop to use up credits, has answears for all?<\/p>\n","username":"Lyckan","cards":{"01005":2,"01008":2,"01012":1,"01026":1,"01034":3,"01041":1,"01042":1,"01043":1,"02003":1,"02009":2,"02049":3,"02065":1,"02066":1,"02082":1,"02091":1,"02107":2,"03035":1,"03038":3,"03040":2,"03041":3,"03042":1,"03046":3,"03048":1,"04003":1,"04067":1,"06017":1,"06019":2,"06038":3}},{"id":9085,"name":"Haiku","creation":"2014-08-30 12:32:40","description":"<p>three copies<\/p>\n\n<p>five-three agendas<\/p>\n\n<p>twice suffice<\/p>\n\n<p>.<\/p>\n\n<p>haiku ice<\/p>\n\n<p>only a stranger<\/p>\n\n<p>chimera<\/p>\n\n<p>.<\/p>\n\n<p>search the six<\/p>\n\n<p>play cards deceptive<\/p>\n\n<p>force the eight<\/p>\n\n<p>.<\/p>\n\n<p>defy time<\/p>\n\n<p>NeoTokyo restricts?<\/p>\n\n<p>analyze<\/p>\n\n<p>.<\/p>\n\n<p>retreat soon<\/p>\n\n<p>no need for Howard<\/p>\n\n<p>drop evils<\/p>\n\n<p>.<\/p>\n\n<p>feed Thomas<\/p>\n\n<p>caught or forgotten<\/p>\n\n<p>always helps<\/p>\n","username":"Contrast","cards":{"01069":3,"01075":3,"01089":3,"01100":3,"02015":3,"02033":3,"02039":3,"02060":3,"03012":3,"04093":2,"05001":1,"05007":3,"05011":3,"05014":3,"05015":3,"05021":3}},{"id":9086,"name":"2014 Nationals Top 64 - The New 'Riel","creation":"2014-08-30 13:02:17","description":"\n","username":"ooogene","cards":{"01007":1,"01017":1,"01018":3,"01019":3,"01021":3,"01022":3,"01024":3,"01026":1,"01028":2,"01032":1,"01049":1,"02043":2,"02066":1,"02085":2,"02091":1,"02104":3,"03038":2,"03049":1,"03054":3,"04004":3,"04043":1,"05046":1,"05048":2,"06014":2}},{"id":9087,"name":"Nasir Workshop","creation":"2014-08-30 13:07:11","description":"<p>This is still a work in progress, but I think I'm getting closer.

Disruptive Anarch tools are used to extend this advantage for as long as possible to win before the Corp manages to stabilize the board and start scoring. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Economy:<\/strong> The primary economic piece is Magnum Opus, but heavy card draw and Freelance Coding Contract can provide a quick boost in the economy while allowing Professor to utilize programs from heap. Test Run's first job is to help get out Magnum Opus. After this, the deck is supplemented by the burst of Sure Gamble and Freelance Coding Contract and recurring credits from Sahasrara and The Toolbox. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Icebreakers:<\/strong> The setup is pretty standard, taking the easiest to deploy and utilize. A slight exception would be my code gate solution where I used Cyber-Cypher mainly for remotes and Passport for centrals instead of using ZU.13 Key Master, but it's still up for consideration. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Programs:<\/strong> My primary strategy is to disrupt the Corporation so Keyhole, instead of Medium, became my main choice. For HQ, I use Nerve Agent for the multi-access to be combined and used with Imp to trash key Corp cards for more disruption. This is also my solution for Scorched Earth so this combo becomes more important vs Scorched Earth decks. <\/p>\n\n<p>As you can see my only memory solution is The Toolbox and Leprechauns. Toolbox helps extend the range of the cheap icebreakers when the bigger ice start coming out and also functions well for opening up MU through +MU and also +2 Link for Zu13.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Update:<\/strong><br \/>\n- <em>Removed -1 Lamprey, -1 Scavenge, Added +1 Sahasrara, +1 Test Run:<\/em> there was issues when drawing multiple scavenges and wish they were something else like Test Run. Lamprey was unimpressive when my buddy used 2 of them on me, they lacked a lot of punch. Added Sahasrara is a program that also helps provide an economic boost, combos with Clone Chip and SMC as well.<br \/>\n- <em>Removed -1 Quality Time, -1 Cyber Cypher -1 Passport, -1 Crescentus Added +1 Escher, +2 Magnum Opus, +1 Zu13 Key Master:<\/em> Magnum Opus is too important to not have 3 copies of to ensure I get it out early especially without having to burn a Test Run (but its still its first main job in deck). Plus additionally drawn Opus's = FCC fodder. Crescentus was a bit situational so it was an easy slot to remove for it then I squeezed my two code-gate solutions into 1 with Zu13 and that frees up another card slot. Peekay's deck helped convince me that Escher could be a huge card to play and I figured with 3x Magnum Opus, I can afford a little less draw power so -1 Quality Time for it.<br \/>\n<em>- Removed -1 Leprechaun, -1 Djinn, -1 SMC, Added +2 The Toolbox, +2 Knight:<\/em> I didn't like having to put out Daemons early to make good use of them especially because they were my only memory solution. This setup allows me to delegate the 2 Leprechauns left in deck as a later game Memory solution and allows me to just draw for Magnum Opus and put it out ASAP. With The Toolbox, I think this combo works out great and can solve most if not all memory issues that I would run across. The Toolbox also extends the range for using my cheap icebreakers regularly when bigger, harder to break ice start coming out. Knight was placed in deck as an additional solution for big ice in case I run across multiples and increases the chances of me drawing into a big ice solution like Femme Fatale and Knight.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Thoughts? Opinions? Ideas?<\/p>\n\n<p>Props to Peekay's Professor deck, which pushed me to run 2 more copies of Magnum Opus and an Escher: \n<a href=\"http:\/\/netrunnerdb.com\/en\/decklist\/7546\/vivat-academia\">Vivat Academia<\/a><\/p>\n","username":"jairoe03","cards":{"01007":1,"01008":2,"01011":1,"01012":1,"01026":1,"01028":1,"01034":3,"01041":2,"01044":3,"01050":2,"02003":1,"02007":1,"02041":1,"02047":3,"02066":1,"02087":2,"02104":1,"03029":1,"03031":1,"03033":3,"03034":2,"03035":2,"03038":3,"03046":2,"03047":1,"04043":1,"04061":1,"06019":2}},{"id":9100,"name":"Meat Sandwich 1.0.1","creation":"2014-08-30 20:08:19","description":"<p>Tweaked the ice.

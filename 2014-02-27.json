Looking over the cards I felt this deck benefited greatly from e3 Feedback implants. With e3 Knight becomes even better, it breaks an archer for 5c(!), an Ichi 2.0 for 4c, Hadrians wall for 3c, etc. This also mitigates peacocks drawback for cheaper code gates (enigma, datapike, etc) while giving you a huge boost against Heimdall 1.0, Ichi 1.0, Eli, etc.\nWith the ability to get into HQ easier with Knight I dropped an inside job (which doesn't work well with account siphon even if it does with Gabes ability) and with the INF saved from Yog (I truly prefer boostable breakers over Yog without Sucker tokens) and Indexing I added a Levy and a quality time.

I saw a couple of lists that used Profiteering, and it had a lot of appeal, since I wanted to run a higher econ aggressive version with 3x Biotic Labor and 3x SanSan City Grid. With Profiteering, I hopefully don't need Pop-Up Window or Subliminal Messaging. It's definitely possible to take too much bad pub and enable R&amp;D lock, but used carefully I find it gives me a very helpful infusion of cash to rez the next SanSan \/ use the next Biotic Labor. The right answer seems to usually be to take 10c and 2 BP, not the full 15\/3. <\/p>\n\n<p>I also originally had 3x Anonymous Tip instead of Jackson, but after playing a friend's NBN FA with 3x Biotic and 3x Jackson, I concluded that the flexibility of Jackson to recur Biotics and SanSans would be worth it, especially in a 40-card deck. Running 40 cards instead of 44 increases the odds of seeing one or more of any 3-of in the first 10 cards (hand + 5 turns) by 4.5%, which is pretty significant to me. It's also why I'm not playing 2-ofs in my economy or FA cards. <\/p>\n\n<p>When NAPD Contract comes out, I'll be revising this. <\/p>\n","username":"Ajar","cards":{"01059":3,"01081":3,"01082":3,"01090":2,"01092":3,"01110":3,"01111":2,"02060":2,"02114":1,"02115":3,"03026":1,"04015":3,"04020":3,"04039":3,"04076":3,"04096":3}},{"id":2694,"name":"Clickety-click v1.0    (Rhur Valley + Strongbox)","creation":"2014-02-27 11:11:34","description":"<p>A deck built around the Rhur Valley + Strongbox combo.\nI tried making a Replicating Perfection list first, and a Stronger Together after, but went for Engineering the Future in the end, for two reasons: Bioroids and better economy.

Added some memory, and while the use of a lot of fixed strength Anarch breakers suggested a second datasucker for Prof's 1 influence, the ability to use Stimhack credits to install with SMC and Clone Chip seems too useful to forego. Economy is very vulnerable to tagging\/NBN but I don't know that there is really a better option for the Professor. I keep another Kati and Freelance Coding as spares to swap for the Plascrete if I'm not playing Weyland nor scared of Tag and Bag for some reason(which seems fairly seldom).<br><br>Good combos are the fairly obvious Test Run->Scavenge to get our Femme or Morning Star. Nobody ever expects Sneakdoor Beta from a Shaper so that's great to slap down and either SMC or Clone Chip into Nerve Agent.  <br><br>Obviously not a great tournament deck, but fun (though mentally challenging) to play.

I'll try it some more on otcgn when I get one but I always seemed to be short and waiting on money constantly searching and installing to get the combo up and it only happened one game out of five. So I got irritated and threw together this money deck and breakers and just went screw it. Big rig it is.DMC for mu and link. ACB, DC, HF, and PC for money. Diesel to help draw. Test run\/SMC for breakers. Hostage for Aesop's or PC. Data sucker\/parasite cuz I love it. This deck is pretty straight forward. Get the rig up, run aggressive, kill ice.

The idea is to put a howler with a whirlpool in front of it. if a runner facechecks it expecting their sentry breaker (fairie, mimic, etc) to protect them watch them cry as they brainburn for 4 (hopefully). <br>being jinteki, runner is unlikely to save clicks to break janus so they'll likely take a minimum of 3 brain damage. add in hokusai grid, fetal ai, and snare the runner is screwed. If they take all four they're only two neural EMP away from flatline. I'm dying to get OTCGN working so I can playtest this and other decks. :)<br>Likely a one time tourney deck as once someone knows the strategy it weaken it a lot I think.","username":"HepatitvsJ","cards":{"01067":1,"01068":3,"01070":3,"01072":3,"01075":3,"01077":3,"01110":3,"01113":3,"02012":3,"02014":3,"02032":3,"02054":2,"02094":3,"02095":3,"03016":3,"04012":3,"04015":3,"04032":2}},{"id":630,"name":"Kate's Rig 3.1","creation":"2013-11-21 23:45:12","description":"Meant to be versatile yet fast.

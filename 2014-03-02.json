I'm hoping to run it in an upcoming local tournament this month. The basic idea is just to make it extremely cost inefficient (in terms of both clicks and credits) for the runner to run on your remote servers. Try to get economy going through Sundews and PAD Campaigns early. Most runners won't try to trash a PAD campaign, but you will probably need some sort of protection for the Sundews early. Use Interns to recur whatever the runner ends up trashing (it most likely cost him more than it cost you) and most of the time the runner will give up on trashing your economy which gives you a big advantage. Protect Agendas in a strong remote with Ash and possibly a Hokusai and you'll find the runner needs to invest at least 3 clicks and a truckload of credits just to access your single agenda. I'm looking for suggestions on how to make the deck more competitive and improve it in general.<\/p>\n","username":"I Fight Dragons","cards":{"01068":3,"01070":2,"01078":1,"01104":3,"01109":3,"02013":2,"02014":3,"02029":3,"02031":1,"02032":1,"02033":2,"02039":2,"02060":2,"02095":3,"03027":2,"04015":3,"04033":1,"04054":3,"04060":3,"04073":3,"04074":3,"04077":1}},{"id":2803,"name":"Toc Toc!","creation":"2014-03-02 17:50:38","description":"<p>C'est ferm\u00e9!

Knight is super awesome in Gabe.  Emergency shutdown came in second and sneakdoor third pushing lots of economic pressure.  Mr. Li might take third, but its hard to gauge his worth, but in Gabe, Mr. Li is king.<\/p>\n\n<p>Duds:  Daily casts.  The tempo hit is just too bad for how long it takes to pay off.  I think I played 1 all day, and it was insurance against being broke in the future.  This stinker is coming back out for armitage or something else.  Indexing under performed netting 1 2 pointer, but we'll forgive it.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Decoy was a meta call against power shutdown combo decks since GRNDL is my worst match.  I'm putting in blackmail and rejiggering to include same old thing to punish this shit out of GRNDL remotes.

It was very similar to the deck I have been playing so far, but I have made some adjustments to my liking:<\/p>\n\n<p>-1 Professional Contacts\n-1 John Masanori\n+1 Mr. Li\nI'm in favor of a good draw, I will get the credits from a different source. I find Professional Contacts a bit too pricey and Mr. Li does not cost any influence. I'm not very fond of John Masanori, since it is just a danger for itself and the other contacts.<\/p>\n\n<p>-1 Corroder\n+1 Atman\nThe icebreakers are quite the same, this is the only difference. I just felt I have to include an Atman, because it works together so well with Datasuckers. The -1 Corroder is a bit of a pain, but I have to get some influence from somewhere.<\/p>\n\n<p>-1 Emergency Shutdown\n-1 Easy Mark\n-1 Inside Job\n+1 Stimhack\n+3 Daily Casts\nI have cut down a bit from the criminal events to make room for some credit cards.

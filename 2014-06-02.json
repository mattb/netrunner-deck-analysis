Remove an indexing and stimhack, adding a same old thing and a feedback filter. \nThe feedback filter is really due to Honor and Profit, Jinteki is showing a lot more and the option of spending credits to avoid card loss can be very useful (money isn't much of a problem to this deck). For the same reason, I found stimhack mostly redundant - so another SOT just gives so many options with more than half the deck being events. <\/p>\n\n<p>Basic strategy for this deck is to go for money first unless something very tempting comes up like an unguarded r&amp;d where i draw indexing. So I'll mulligan most hands if I don't start with a Magnum Opus. Though I'll keep if I have a test run and other premium cards. When plascrete is up, consider going full tag-me. <\/p>\n\n<p>My ideal setup with breakers is to get the Morning Star on the Dino. Since money is easy to get, and test run\/scavenge giving free big breakers - I like the option of getting both femmes out.

I\u2019m good like that.<\/p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s been through several iterations and initially started with Lucky Find in (hence the name), I\u2019ve come to the conclusion that the initial build full of cash wasn\u2019t consistent so the deck now runs on fairly minimal economy. That\u2019s okay because everything is cheap to play and Closed Accounts is a non-issue.  Key to enduring longevity is <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01047\">Aesop's Pawnshop<\/a>, <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01005\">Cyberfeeder<\/a>s work hard for you and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01053\">Armitage Codebusting<\/a> can boost you up for a Sure Gamble or otherwise dig you out of a hole.<\/p>\n\n<p>There are lots of viruses.  I\u2019d like there to be more variety but the card pool is what it is.  <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04005\">Gorman Drip v1<\/a> is excellent \u2013 it\u2019s the first card people say I should drop and one of the last I\u2019d actually get rid of.  Against the likes of Cerebral Imaging, lots of Jinteki decks, any corp that draws or clicks for credits; it earns you lots of cash.  If you can get 2-3 out, the Corp player has to think long and hard before every click and will often take sub-optimal actions in order to avoid giving you cash.  Also they\u2019ll purge more often and waste whole turns.  If your opponent is playing round them, pawn one or two and still turn a profit (especially if you played with free <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01005\">Cyberfeeder<\/a> credits).<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"\/en\/card\/02003\">Imp<\/a> is your defence against combos, killing Scorched or other key cards, and trashing SanSan or Eve Campaign is easy.  Also good for destroying economy cards or Ice out of R&amp;D and HQ (whichever one the corp seems short of).  To be honest I usually Imp whatever I see.  With 3 of them in the deck, three <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01002\">D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu<\/a> and two <a href=\"\/en\/card\/03038\">Clone Chip<\/a> spend them merrily.  Another card that can encourage a Purge from the corp.<\/p>\n\n<p>The other key card is <a href=\"\/en\/card\/03055\">The Source<\/a>.  A typically play if you\u2019re short on money is to Imp an accessed agenda and go get it later.  When you\u2019re ready to collect, pawn the Source and get cash then go pick up your agenda bounty.  This card also stops Fast Advance decks from just blasting past you with speed.  If they burn lots of cards to over score an agenda you can always D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu it back and play it again (after a bit of a look to see if you can steal something first).  I did very well against both Cerebral Imaging and NBN TWIY \u2013 my only loss against the former was when I\u2019d seen a Scorched and ran too aggressively afterwards getting my house burned down.  Remember to keep on top of economy or (more likely) Imp away SE or Punitive, there\u2019s no Carapace in this deck.  Be sure to check Archives every now and then \u2013 getting info on which threats have already been milled can help make your runs safer.<\/p>\n\n<p>I\u2019d suggest running reasonably aggressively to start with, get ice rezzed and have a look at what you\u2019re dealing with.  This should help slow the corp down and give you targets for <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01012\">Parasite<\/a>.  Getting <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01016\">Wyldside<\/a> out is good, but if it\u2019s not there take at least one click a turn drawing.  You can use most of what you see on three credits or less and clicking for the odd credit too isn\u2019t a problem (although ideally you\u2019ll want to see an Armitage or something early).  Don\u2019t be scared of Wyldside flooding your hand and having to discard.  You can probably recur whatever goes in the bin and I\u2019ve never run out of cards in my deck, plus extra versions of Wyldside, Grimoire etc. need clearing out of your deck.<\/p>\n\n<p>if the corp is reluctant to rez ice or leaves the centrals open you can drop a <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02041\">Nerve Agent<\/a>, <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01010\">Medium<\/a> or <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04082\">Hemorrhage<\/a>.  I rarely get to use them in the classic sense, but they soon get the corp using clicks or credits protecting centrals and not scoring agendas.  And if they don\u2019t\u2026 cool.  I\u2019ll see five cards in R&amp;D please (and Imp some, plus <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01008\">Datasucker<\/a> etc).<\/p>\n\n<p>Depending on how things are going, about a third to half way through a game you might want to switch to a less aggressive stance and run infrequently or stop running altogether.  Milling someone out is a finely balanced game, and it often comes down to the wire.  Don\u2019t be frightened of losing programs by trashing over them or feeding Aesops.  There\u2019s a good amount of recursion and plenty of cheap stuff.  By now you should have Wyldside, Grimoire, Aesops, maybe the Source, and a bunch of diverse programs that allow you to pressure some areas if you really need to \u2013 just time your run well and don\u2019t leave yourself open to tags or Scorched if you can help it.<\/p>\n\n<p>Kill Jackson if you see him.  Kill him in the face.  Except\u2026  if the corp player is drawing like a madman and not scoring then you can arguably leave him.  With the Corp drastically drawing and not scoring, he\u2019s thinning his deck wonderfully.  Try and hit HQ to get some of the good stuff he\u2019s holding onto, or grab some Hemorrhage counters and get him to discard his own.  Eventually Jackson\u2019ll get used but let the corp do some work for you.  Mainly though, kill Jackson in the face \u2013 note if he\u2019s protected, running Archives normally has the same effect.<\/p>\n\n<p>I put <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01004\">Stimhack<\/a> in thinking at some point I\u2019d want to make a glory run and burst into a server to steal something at the last minute.

Rainbow is in there to fill the same taxing role as bastion, without necessarily drawing out a barrier breaker. This can be helpful if you are trying to protect centrals without throwing off your hive strategy. <\/p>\n\n<p>-I reduced the number of hives to 2, because they were becoming deadweight lategame, and usually even if I got one really early, it wasn't safe trying to score it yet, and I would end up tossing one in the trash. <\/p>\n\n<p>-Threw in 1 Closed Accounts to assist against recurring siphon decks. <\/p>\n\n<p>-Threw in 2 Biotic Labors to assist with getting out an early Gila Hands, or scoring from hand if absolutely necessary. <\/p>\n\n<p>-Dropped the number of traps to 2, as I felt the only purpose for having more was for the runner to see one off R&amp;D or HQ, and then allow me to bluff out a mushin. Most of the time they were just flooding me.<\/p>\n\n<p>The value of Jackson Howard cannot be overstated. He single handedly gives you the ability to dig for the exact pieces you need to make your combo successful, drawing past the agendas you don't need right now to get the mandatory upgrades. Also, once you have scored mandatory upgrades, simply having him on the table allows you to trigger an accelerated beta test from hand safely.<\/p>\n\n<p>Archived Memories is a powerful card that I have learned to love in this deck.

Last but not least, two Plascretes, because Scorched Earth is still a thing.<\/p>\n\n<p>Strategy: <\/p>\n\n<p>Early game: Keep a central server open at all times via parasite recursion. Aim to get two datasuckers in play ASAP and just disrupt the corp early on. You will manage to hit a central with a run event and hopefully pull 2-3 points.<\/p>\n\n<p>Mid game: When they attempt to either wall up centrals or establish a remote server, drop an Atman (usually 0). Use planned assault to abuse where you think the agendas are, whether it is index, maker's eye, or legwork. Hopefully you can seal the game here as the corp either cannot protect centrals well enough, or establish a safe remote server.<\/p>\n\n<p>Late Game: Escher can wreck a corp when they think they have a safe remote server and drop your winning agenda behind it. Go get it.<\/p>\n\n<p>Weaknesses: <\/p>\n\n<p>Memory is low so operating off one Atman is typical.<\/p>\n\n<p>Long games; This deck is fast, and can fizzle in the late game. I think 1 Levy may fix that.<\/p>\n\n<p>Corps with a high ice count, mainly HB because Jinteki, NBN, and Weyland all seem to run 16-18 ice these days...<\/p>\n","username":"th3p4yn3","cards":{"01008":2,"01012":1,"01026":1,"01033":1,"01034":2,"01036":1,"01050":3,"02009":2,"02047":2,"02066":1,"02087":3,"02106":1,"03034":2,"03038":3,"03040":2,"03046":3,"03048":1,"03052":3,"03054":3,"04029":3,"04067":1,"04109":2,"05035":1,"05036":2}}]

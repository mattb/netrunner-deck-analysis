False Echo is more of a nuisance than a real danger, but might still remove ICE when the Corp is low on money, and then it really shines. Corp will have to install again, losing time and potentially money (since they might need to spend all their clicks for credits, but if there is no ICE left on a remote...).<br><br>- The Helpful AI wasn't actually helpful at all, removed.<br>- Self-modifying Code up to 3 copies.<br>- Added a single copy of Crypsis to have a jack-of-all-trades with non-fixed STR.<br>- The Maker's Eye switched with R&D Interface, as per suggestion.","username":"paddosan","cards":{"01012":3,"01033":1,"01050":3,"01051":1,"02007":1,"02027":1,"02028":2,"02043":3,"02065":3,"02069":3,"02089":1,"02090":2,"02091":3,"02107":2,"03035":1,"03038":3,"03040":3,"03046":3,"03049":3,"03050":2,"04007":2}},{"id":386,"name":"HB: Braintrust","creation":"2013-11-03 21:32:53","description":"Idea is to use Biotic to FA the Mandatory Upgrades and let it just spiral out of control (in a good way).

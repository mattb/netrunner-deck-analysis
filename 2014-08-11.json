It's not like standard Criminal builds that seek to break the Corp with a constant 'lock' or devastating Siphontrain, but instead allow you to suddenly hit out of nowhere with your hard-hitting run events. The central 'puzzle' of this deck is identifying your windows of opportunities for your run events to connect well. Making the nerve wracking decision to do an all-in Hail Mary run to decide the game is more common with this deck than many others, and that I think, is the spirit of Ken \"Express\" Tenma. <\/p>\n\n<p>---The philosophy of 'Express'<\/p>\n\n<p>The issue with many Tenma decks I see out there is simply, wouldnt that exact same build just be better with Andy or especially Gab? .<\/p>\n\n<p>Gab's ability encourages 1 strong run (preferably HQ) every turn, and many would think that Express should be built the same furious way, or adopt Andy's insane cheap constant runs fashion. However, I think that Express' ability encourages sprints, and not marathons. That 1 cred per run event is not meant to fuel an economy (like how Gab's can be), but instead make those big occasional clutch runs just that much slightly easier to pull off. In fact, the design decision to have Ken's free cred kick-in on <em>play<\/em> of a run event and not on a successful <em>conclusion<\/em> of gives us a good sense of how an Express deck should be built.<\/p>\n\n<p>---The backbone of the deck<\/p>\n\n<p>Setting up to play 3x <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01036\">The Maker's Eye<\/a> and 3x <a href=\"\/en\/card\/05035\">Legwork<\/a> is your goal with this deck. <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02106\">Indexing<\/a> is a pretty sweet killer if you can find the opportunity. Spending entire turns just clicking for creds and prepping for a sudden 3 card access next turn is Express' style. Keep probing servers like any good Criminal early game. Once you are shut out of cheap ( ~1 cred after Desperado) single card accesses, start setting up for Makers\/Legworks. <\/p>\n\n<p>This deck has been through many iterations and many plays, and has a pretty good success rate. Quite often it just comes down to whether your Makers or Legs hit. Additionally, it is decent against the glacial RP these days. Taxing ice is not so much a concern for you as your game plan is not to hit every turn. The deck is ready for you to just pick up and play, so long as you remember the mantra of 'sprints, not marathons'. Read on though, if you want a more in-depth discussion of the rationale behind the card choices.<\/p>\n\n<p>3x <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01053\">Armitage Codebusting<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>The economic option of Armitage exemplifies the spirit of Express. It's click intensive, but that's fine, what you are looking for is just a flexible source of credits you can use to exploit open windows of opportunities for your run events. <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02091\">Kati Jones<\/a> might theoretically fit the explosive nature of the deck well, but in practical terms she simply is too slow and inflexible to allow you to seize the same said windows. Drawing Kati multiples sucks too, plus she telegraphs to the Corp when you are about to attack and the good Corp player can and will respond accordingly. <a href=\"\/en\/card\/03053\">Daily Casts<\/a> suffers for the same reason, in that its returns come too slow.<\/p>\n\n<p>1x <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01018\">Account Siphon<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>Only 1 Siphon? If you want to do the Siphontrain-beatdown-then exploit, just go Gab or Andy builds, they do it more effectively. That said, an AS hit at the right time is still as devastating as ever, but keep in mind it's not your primary goal.<\/p>\n\n<p>3x <a href=\"\/en\/card\/05038\">Public Terminal<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>Why not <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04029\">Prepaid VoicePAD<\/a>? \nWith Terminals, you are trading long term efficiency for faster returns, which is what Express needs for his sprints. A PPVP economy (as evidenced why it works so well in Shapers), is that it needs fast draw power to work too, and Criminals lack that. Good Shutdown protection too. <\/p>\n\n<p>3x <a href=\"\/en\/card\/05033\">Express Delivery<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>I just love this card. For me, I am happily willing to trade away the 3rd <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01024\">Desperado<\/a>, <a href=\"\/en\/card\/03054\">Same Old Thing<\/a>, and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01022\">Special Order<\/a> for the flexibility and 'clutch' nature of Express Delivery. A tip, this card tends to get better as the game goes on and your deck thins out. So, still doing normal draws when you already have an Express Delivery in hand can sometimes be a pretty good idea. When you are at a critical juncture of a game when you desperately need an answer, an emergency Express Delivery can be a Runner's Jackson Howard hallelujah moment. Best of all, unlike Special Order, I like that you do not have to reveal what you picked, which simply <em>terrifies<\/em> the Corp. <\/p>\n\n<p>---The breaker suite<\/p>\n\n<p>3x <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02104\">Faerie<\/a> is necessary for when you are early probing centrals, if just to see what kind of breakers you need. A solid 3 of.<\/p>\n\n<p>3x <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04043\">Knight<\/a>. Fulfills 2 functions. First is that you can sit a Knight unhosted out on the table, and the Corp will take bigger caution in building a remote expecting a Inside Job + Knight. This is when you hit with a <a href=\"\/en\/card\/05035\">Legwork<\/a>. Second is that it will help you with problematic ice your central breakers have trouble going through well, such as how any strength 5 code gates cruelly gives <a href=\"\/en\/card\/05046\">Passport<\/a> fits. 5 credits to get through a Knighted Tollbooth is actually decent when you compare to other breaker options. Discounting Femme of course, and that leads us to..<\/p>\n\n<p>Why no <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01026\">Femme Fatale<\/a>?\nFemme is best in decks where you run often to exploit her ability, or especially in Siphontrain games where huge credit swings are common. With Tenma, sinking 9 into a Femme is too much, even if it allows for the unexpected Indexing or similar.<\/p>\n\n<p>All in all, your breaker suite is not designed to hit remotes that much, but Knights and Inside Jobs give you good flexibility in that area.<\/p>\n\n<p>*Just be smart against the annoying Jinteki PE decks, your entire play-style has to change since your biggest resource to be concerned with is no longer credits nor clicks but instead cards in hand, but since that applies to many other Runner decks too, I shall not go into it here.<\/p>\n","username":"Sojourne","cards":{"01007":1,"01018":1,"01021":3,"01022":2,"01024":2,"01036":3,"01050":3,"01053":3,"02009":2,"02104":3,"02106":1,"03052":3,"03054":2,"04043":3,"05029":1,"05033":3,"05035":3,"05036":2,"05038":3,"05041":1,"05046":1}},{"id":8448,"name":"CTZ_SF_NEXT_2.0","creation":"2014-08-11 04:18:14","description":"<p>NEXT Design with no core cards (For a special local format in SF).

The first thing you'll notice is agenda composition: seven 3-pointers plus Domestic Sleepers. There are 7 cards in this deck that further the runner's chances of winning, and he needs to steal 3 of them in order to win. You, on the other hand, only need two of those seven in addition to scoring a Sleepers out of hand.<\/p>\n\n<p>There are two other cards you might be curious about: Fast Track and Punitive Counterstrike. Fast Track (with Biotic Labor, if necessary) lets you make sure you score Sleepers in case the runner gets lucky and steals one of them; it can also pull Eden Fragment to your hand if the runner's in a bad position; scoring that lets you build up your taxing superservers <strong>at a profit<\/strong>. Nail that as your first agenda, and you've practically won the game. Punitive is your alternate win condition; if you have two in hand and a decently taxing server hiding an agenda, you either score 3 or disappear the runner when he steals it. Bonus points for Punitive always hitting for 3 (or, in the worst-case scenario, 6).<\/p>\n\n<h4>Ice<\/h4>\n\n<p>Ice is a good split of taxing and gear check; Static\/Quandary\/Fenris are my cheap hard ETR, while the remainder are just expensive as hell to break. Ice composition is definitely the most up for rejigging, especially if you can free up some space if Jackson proves to be unnecessary. Heimdall and Janus are primarily PriReq food, but you're EtF, so you can probably hard rez them in a pinch. Tollbooth and Ichi are good targets for PriReq too.<\/p>\n\n<h4>Other Options<\/h4>\n\n<p>There's definitely an alternate build of this that gets rid of the Overwriter, kill setup Brain Damage ice, and Punitives in favor of Aggressive Secretary, Will-o', Rototurret, Taurus, and Flare; that build would be centred on snapping off the runner's rig and blowing open scoring windows to push to 7 points.<\/p>\n\n<h4>Wait! No Archer?!<\/h4>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Everyone will expect it. The runner can save their Sharpshooter for the single Ichi in this deck, if they ever see it.<\/li>\n<li>You only have two Sleepers, and you want to be scoring one of them every game that you're not going for a flatline.

Read it there.<\/p>\n\n<p>Basic strategy, score a 4\/2 as soon as it is possible. If the runner steals the first one, no sweat they have either made your next <a href=\"\/en\/card\/05005\">Medical Breakthrough<\/a> cheaper to score or have drained their economy paying for a <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04119\">NAPD Contract<\/a> and opened a scoring window for another 4\/2 agenda. You want to get to 4 AP as quickly as possible so that the runner feels pressure to run your servers rather than sitting back counting their money waiting to pounce. A poor Runner is a very sad Runner against this deck.<\/p>\n\n<p>I rarely try to push a 5\/3 out in the early game as they are just too vulnerable. I wait until my economy is humming and I have a solid scoring server setup with <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02013\">Ash 2X3ZB9CY<\/a> and\/or <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04114\">Caprice Nisei<\/a> ideally or I sacrifice a <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04119\">NAPD Contract<\/a> to open a scoring window.<\/p>\n\n<p>Changes:\nI dumped <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01077\">Neural Katana<\/a> for a 3rd <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04013\">Himitsu-Bako<\/a>. This is a good card to kill Cassias with or anything someone has hosted on there. I have also used this in front of a Jackson to bait a run and then I make the server disappear... sad when that Dirty Laundry fails to land.<\/p>\n\n<p>Not one to believe the hype about how useless a card is I saw some potential in <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02071\">Hourglass<\/a>. Normally, you can wait for a 4th click run and completely ignore this card and that really does suck in most decks. However, in a horizontal deck where clicks are a premium it becomes a serious liability to the runner. You either focus on Centrals and my drip econ runs wild or you pay a hefty price to break it and then run on my servers. <\/p>\n\n<p>Let\u2019s talk about <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04060\">Interns<\/a>. I am sure some folks would disagree with my choice and would rather have some sort of burst econ instead. They are invaluable to the taxing nature of this deck. Interns allows you to let <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04015\">Jackson Howard<\/a> to be trashed, costing the runner 3 precious credits that could have been used to steal an agenda or trash my drip assets. Now I can bring back a Jackson anytime I need one from the archive. If the Jacksons are safe I can stack ICE without draining my early econ. You can also bring back Ash or Caprice which really pisses runners off.<\/p>\n\n<p>This deck performed well never dropping a game but I barely squeaked a game against Kit running Yog-o-sarus (also running Paint Brush).

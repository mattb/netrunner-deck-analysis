Silhouette is uniquely positioned, thanks to her ability, in always knowing which cards to access or not access with a Quest Completed.  Having no multi-access for R&amp;D available, this deck aims to make the most of the new Legwork card to target fast advance and Cerebral Imaging's most vulnerable point, their agenda cluttered hand.  Magnum Opus provides more money than we can dream of, plenty to play big draws like Quality Time and to leverage our Doppelganger's ability to let us pressure harder than other Runners.  Feint and Emergency Shutdown will also allow us to put more economic pressure on the corp as well.  Finally, Notoriety can grant a surprise win from as few as 4 to 7 with use of Early Bird + Doppelganger.  I decided to include the new S&amp;W '35 hardware both as Power Shutdown defense and as a way to remove pesky Jackson Howards from the Corps remotes.  The other option was Silencer which would give us more of an economic advantage by making our first sentry use each turn cheaper, but I decided to give the new toy a try first.<\/p>\n","username":"Flashfires","cards":{"01018":3,"01022":2,"01044":2,"01050":3,"02009":2,"02026":3,"02043":2,"02064":2,"02087":2,"03054":2,"04081":3,"05030":1,"05032":1,"05034":2,"05035":3,"05039":2,"05041":2,"05042":2,"05046":2}},{"id":5119,"name":"Notorious Daily Quester","creation":"2014-05-06 11:58:17","description":"<p>Second verse same as the first, now put me on a plane so I can put 'em in a hurse.

It might actually be more economy than needed.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Events<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>In addition to the burst economy events, I wanted to include notoriety and quest complete. I'm not sure if quest complete is needed, but it has been incredibly easy to hit all 3 servers with the combo of central breakers, doppelganger, and early bird. I'm also considering removing planned assault even though it seems useful to be able to tutor up siphon, legwork, or inside job. I would like to include other powerful events like emergency shutdown or indexing, but I'm not sure what to cut to fit them.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Breakers<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>I liked the idea of going breaker light and using clone chips to get back trashed breakers. Clone chips seem even more valuable against the soon to be Jinteki heavy meta. I replaced the inefficient breach with a corroder and kept the other two central breakers. I have considered including one or two backups like faerie or crypsis, but I don't know what to cut. I also have a variant  of this deck with datasuckers and anarch breakers and no quest complete. I need to test that as well to see which is more efficient.<\/p>\n\n<p>I'm really enjoying the aggression and combo potential of this deck so far. It takes what I enjoyed about Andromeda and intensifies my desire to run early and often. There are so many other events I would like to be able to include, but deck space gets so tight. Specifically I want some Jinteki counters like Deus X. Any advice on changes is appreciated.

Iain's style seems to be slow-but-steady-wins-the-race.<\/p>\n\n<p>The events in this deck are also different from the usual Criminal tools. The cards included here are strictly for tutoring the cards you need and to pay for the installs. The Helpful AI, Rabbit Holes and Borrowed Satellites ensure that Underworld Contacts (a.k.a \"dirty money\") are providing credits early while also enabling a larger hand size and heavy link defense. Calling In Favors is primarily intended for the mid-to-late game to provide powerful burst economy for runs when you have your network up and running.<\/p>\n\n<p>Summary Gameplay: Get your network in-place as quickly as possible. Use Hostage to get Professional Contacts, Kati Jones, and The Helpful AI (a.k.a, the \"Triumverate\") into play early, or use them for Underworld Contacts if you draw into the Triumverate. Is the Corp fast-advancing agendas? Take advantage and use Iain's ability to grab those breakers faster. Use the dedicated breakers to put pressure on the centrals. Use Cripsis and Ninja to get into remotes when necessary. Ninja is there for Swordsman.<\/p>\n\n<p>Remember: this is the Criminal that shines in the mid-to-late game, like a Shaper.

It's current record is 12-1 (the only loss came from a friend playing it for the first time against me) and shows no sign of slowing down. <\/p>\n\n<p>The main advantage of this ID is that it provides no opportunity for the runner to slow down and regain control. The runner has to constantly maintain pressure lest he be outscored in 3-4 turns. This leads to runners making mistakes they wouldn't normally make. I usually win by scoring 6 points (it's alarmingly easy), but I have often won by kill too. Interestingly, if you notice, going for the kill is not the aim of this deck. Instead, damage is simply used to slow the runner down. But, funny things can happen like killing the runner with Yagura :P<\/p>\n\n<p>Agendas:<\/p>\n\n<p>Braintrust - Simply a 3\/2 agenda that gets points. Sucks a little when these get stolen<\/p>\n\n<p>Medical Breakthrough - This card is GOOD, like Astro good. Honestly, you kind of want the first one to get stolen. That brings down the next one to a 3\/2, and then you can fast track the other one for an easy 2\/2. One game, threw 2 of these and MHC down in open remotes. Runner hit 1 of them (just like I hoped), then on my turn, got a buck from MHC and scored the other. Next turn, scored the other from hand and we were at match point. That just feels good :)<\/p>\n\n<p>NAPD Contract - Everybody knows this agenda is awesome and in here is works great. Because of how much pressure the runner is under, they often have just enough money to get into a server. I have seen many NAPD\u2019s just stared at and put back down. <\/p>\n\n<p>Philotic Entanglement - God, kills me that this is only a 1 per deck! Again, another 3\/2 and it slows the runner down if they scored anything. While I prefer to score this if they have already stolen 1-2 agendas, but I\u2019ll score it right away if need. You are preferably scoring an agenda at least every 1-2 turns, 3 at the most.<\/p>\n\n<p>Assets:<\/p>\n\n<p>Jackson Howard - What can be said? He does whatever you need. Draw, archive saves, etc. He also works great as a bluff. I rarely end up keeping him on the board long, so I\u2019ll stick him in a protected server and let the runner run it thinking he\u2019s an agenda. This tactic works great in this deck. Everything starts to look like an agenda. <\/p>\n\n<p>Mental Health Clinic - This is a fun card. Again, I\u2019m not trying to flatline the runner, so the 1 plus card doesn\u2019t bother me. Instead the runner is faced with a problem: let me have 1 credit or spend 3 and not get an extra card\u2026. hmmm  :) I\u2019ll also use this as a bluff<\/p>\n\n<p>Snare! - Again, slow them down and make them fear you. It can kill, but usually not unless is gets pulled towards the end of the game when they get desperate and reckless. I sometimes use this as an agenda bluff, but only if the runner has proven that they will run everything that I lay down. Otherwise, keep it in hand for when Celebrity shows up. <\/p>\n\n<p>Upgrades:<\/p>\n\n<p>Caprice Nisei - She is boss. Shoot, often I\u2019ll throw her down,immediately rezz and the runner ignores that server the rest of the game. Perfect\u2026.<\/p>\n\n<p>SanSan City Grid - Strictly speaking, you don\u2019t NEED this to win, but it sure helps. At the very least, you soak up 5 credits on the trash. Then you just Jackson it back in...<\/p>\n\n<p>Operations:<\/p>\n\n<p>Celebrity Gift - Not much to say. Makes money when you don\u2019t have a lot. <\/p>\n\n<p>Fast Track - This is pretty recent addition. I found that I was often digging for the last agenda I needed. Now I can just tutor it up into a hand of Snares and operations<\/p>\n\n<p>Hedge Fund - Yup<\/p>\n\n<p>Medical Research Fundraiser - So, most people have been going back and forth on this card. I like it a lot, but only in the right situation. You have to be careful when you play. If the runner ended their turn with 0-3 credits, then DO NOT play this card. The better time to play this is when the runner is already flush with credits and getting 3 more won\u2019t make much difference. Typically anything over 10 and I\u2019ll play it if I need it. Again, another thing a lot of corps seem to forget is that you shouldn't be blowing through all your money cards as soon as they hit your hand. Hang onto them until you need them. They pad out your HQ and can surprise the runner. <\/p>\n\n<p>ICE:<\/p>\n\n<p>Wall of Static - Go get your Corroder buddy\u2026.<\/p>\n\n<p>Quandary - Go get your Yog<\/p>\n\n<p>Yagura - A great little piece of ice, best on R&amp;D of course<\/p>\n\n<p>Grim - Use this to trash whatever will slow down the runner the most. <\/p>\n\n<p>Guard - Perfect for remote servers and sneaking out an agenda. Also forces a sentry break to come out<\/p>\n\n<p>Komainu - I didn't know what to think of this before, but I freaking love this ice! Sure, it dies to Parasite but no ice is perfect. No matter what, this ice puts a hardship on the runner. Pay 5 credits to get through with a full hand, or drop dangerously low to make it cheap. Interestingly, half the card is taxing, the other half sets up a kill. Very cool <\/p>\n\n<p>Pup - Taxing. Love it. Put it on R&amp;D<\/p>\n\n<p>Swordsman - This is my little surprise ice. If nobody is playing Atman or Knight or Crypsis or Overmind, then you don\u2019t need it. But I\u2019m going to hazard a guess and say that those are showing up a lot these days. :)<\/p>\n\n<p>Tsurugi - Taxing. Also, slim chance, but can setup a kill too. Great ice<\/p>\n\n<p>Anyway, still playing around with the exact composition of everything (thinking about how Mushin can fit into the deck and possibly Shi.Ky\u016b) but I\u2019m pretty stinking happy with how it is performing currently.

The key card for setting up those ambushes\/Trick of Light-batteries is Mushin no Shin.<\/p>\n\n<p>Agendas<\/p>\n\n<p>This is a standard Jinteki-Fast Advance assortment of agendas.  All agendas are worth 2 points, so it always takes 3 agendas to win.  6 out of 9 agendas cost 3 or less (Braintrusts, 2nd and 3rd Medical Breakthroughs, and Philotic Entanglement).  These can all be scored off of 1) a Mushin no Shin, 2) a Mushin'ed Plan B, or 3) a Trick of Light, making use of a failed ambush.  Meanwhile, the 4-difficulty agendas are not meant for scoring, except in need.  The NAPD contracts are taxing to steal, and the 1st Medical Breakthrough is useful regardless of whether it is scored or stolen.<\/p>\n\n<p>Assets<\/p>\n\n<p>There are six ambushes that are meant for Mushin no Shin.  3-advanced Junebugs are great for a flatline.  3-advanced AggSecretaries will curb-stomp a rig, and they are also useful at 1- or 2-advancements, if Mushin is not available.  3-advanced Plan Bs will score 6 out of 9 agendas.  If the runner does not go for these traps, they become Trick of Light batteries.  On the other hand, the GRDNL Refinery can be used as a great infusion of money, whether Mushin'ed (20 creds) or Install-Advance-Advanced (16 creds).  Also, if the runner thinks that you have multiple GRDNL Refineries, then he is more likely to run on your remotes--to his doom.  Meanwhile, Jackson Howard smooths out the flow of agendas.  Shi.Kyu defends Archives, and potentially forces the runner to need 4 agendas to win.<\/p>\n\n<p>Operations<\/p>\n\n<p>Mushin no Shin and Trick of Light are the all-stars in this deck.  The rest of the operations are a variety of economy cards.  This deck does not need a ton of economy, since Mushin and Trick are cheap, and the ICE is pretty affordable.  Also, Mushin no Shin is a sort of economy and a very effective one at that.<\/p>\n\n<p>ICE<\/p>\n\n<p>This is a rush deck, so the ICE layout includes lots of cheap End the Run (Himitsu-Bako, Wall of Static, Quandary, Guard, Chimera).  Guard is included in greater quantity because it is great for single-handedly protecting a Mushin'ed agenda in an early-game rush.  Yagura is a decent early-game helper on R&amp;D.  Hive and Komainu are the big stoppers.  Hive should be useful all the way into the end game, since it will still have a subroutine even at match-point.  Komainu is effectively an ETR, since only a fool would access an unknown Jinteki card after losing his hand.<\/p>\n\n<p>Room for Tweaking<\/p>\n\n<p>I'm still trying to decide what economy operations will be most helpful.  Celebrity Gift is good money and can set up \"mind games,\" but it gives away information.  Subliminal Messaging can goad the runner into trouble or benefit from turns that the runner is recovering from something like a Komainu or Shi.Kyu.  Medical Research Fundraiser is nice, since the ICE is all binary.  If they don't have the right breakers, it doesn't matter how much cash they have.  I went with Celebrity Gifts, but I could change my mind.<\/p>\n\n<p>For the ICE, I am still finding the right formula.  I am tempted to add Grims to \"turn back on\" my binary ICE.  However, the Bad Publicity would hurt my NAPD Contracts.  Right now, the AggSecretaries are doing a good job of program trashing, so that may be enough.<\/p>\n\n<p>If I could find the room, I would love to add some Snares to guard R&amp;D\/HQ, but what would I take out?<\/p>\n","username":"chemnitz","cards":{"01057":2,"01069":2,"01110":3,"01113":1,"02014":3,"02033":3,"02060":2,"04012":2,"04013":2,"04015":2,"04093":1,"04099":1,"04117":2,"04119":2,"04120":2,"05001":1,"05005":3,"05006":1,"05011":1,"05015":3,"05017":1,"05023":2,"05024":3}},{"id":5143,"name":"Psychic Blast","creation":"2014-05-06 18:56:23","description":"<p>This is my first attempt at a Nisei Division deck.

This deck was developed with my good friend Oniya.<\/p>\n\n<p>This deck's main strategy is putting pressure on the Corp's economy with Rook and FAO and ensuring early game access with Knight.<\/p>\n\n<p>Econ: Lots of it.  Though everything in this deck is pretty cheap, Knight is an expensive breaker to use.  For that reason, we went with Hedge Fund, 2 Armitage, 3 Liberated, and 2 Kati Jones.  Swapping a Liberated Accounts for another Armitage is a good idea if you find yourself low on spacebucks often.<\/p>\n\n<p>Deep Red is a no-brainer include in this deck.  Considering our reliance on chess programs, Deep Red is a fantastic increase in efficiency and MU, and is a steal at 2 spacebucks.  It also enables some fun mid-run tricks with Clone Chip.<\/p>\n\n<p>Influence:  FAO.  Really great with Reina's ability or Rook.  Using FAO at +1 spacebucks forces them to think more heavily about their decision.  Using it at +2 or even +3 spacebucks is just mean.  <\/p>\n\n<p>We went with Mr. Li over Contacts as our draw.  This is a deck where you want to find what you need quickly.  Crescentus lets you push their economy even more by making them re-rez Ice, hopefully at an increased cost.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Clone chip is the most important include in this deck.  Chess programs can get trashed pretty easily, so being able to recur them is a must.  We went with Clone chip over other forms of recursion because it allows us to get programs back mid-run, which can save a run or even your life if you're using Deep Red.<\/p>\n\n<p>Other inclusions:  Datasucker, Bishop, and Ice Carver are in here to enable static breakers, for when the Corp has enough Ice to make Knight not enough.<\/p>\n\n<p>A single Medium and Nerve Agent are in here to be searched up with Djinn.

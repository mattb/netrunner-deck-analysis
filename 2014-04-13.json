Nothing new, you've seen the archetype.<\/p>\n\n<p>Here are some notes on piloting:<\/p>\n\n<p>Whizzard: Three free Whizzbucks each turn lets you trash San San City Grid, Marked Accounts or Eve Campaign for $2, and PAD Campaign, Melange Mining Corp, Adonis Campaign, GRNDL Refinery or Jackson Howard for free. Plus: He's magic!<\/p>\n\n<p>Crypsis + Corroder: Crypsis can break any ICE, but obviously carries some drawbacks. Corroder is a highly efficient barrier-breaker, which means those drawbacks only come into play for code gates and sentries.<\/p>\n\n<p>Grimoire: It would have been nice to have the recurring credits from Spinal Modem, but it's a little risky to run the Modem in the current NBN dominated meta. Still, Grimoire is relatively cheap, gives free virus counters to three of the four programs in the deck, and gives you enough memory to run both breakers and have four slots left for Parasites and Datasuckers. I look forward to that glorious day when I've got all three Datasuckers out and just tear through everything without spending a credit.<\/p>\n\n<p>Account Siphon + Deja Vu + Same Old Thing: Play Account Siphon.

It's icing on the cake when you use it for an archives run after a turn of Data Leak Reversal trashing, and it synergizes well with John Masanori and Datasucker.<\/p>\n\n<p>Resources: If you manage to start your turn with a tag, Joshua B and Data Leak Reversal, you can trash five cards from R&amp;D in one go. John Masanori is surprisingly helpful, since you don't care about tags and this decks big weakness is card draw. Fall Guy is just a dick move to make the Corp waste an extra click + $2 before he can get rid of Data Leak Reversal. Ideally you want to have a whole bunch of resources installed before you get your first tag, and once you've started floating tags try to install in batches. It's a lose-lose situation for the Corp when they have to decide between wasting a full turn and $6 to clear them, or letting you keep them on the board.<\/p>\n","username":"RoyalRatAuthority","cards":{"01002":3,"01006":2,"01007":3,"01008":3,"01012":3,"01018":3,"01050":3,"01051":3,"01053":3,"02001":1,"02009":2,"02042":2,"02103":3,"03052":3,"03054":3,"04009":3,"04106":3}},{"id":4181,"name":"Chaos Thievery (Chronos Bratislava First Place)","creation":"2014-04-13 17:01:56","description":"<p>Took 1st with this at our Chronos yesterday, went 3-2 in a field of 19 players from 3 countries (Slovakia, Austria, Hungary).

One of the changes was the inclusion of a Chakana, which I considered the right move even leaving the previous tournament (and which is even more essential now, not just for the NBN matchups but also for the HB ones), the other one is the swap from Tinkerings to Test Runs. <\/p>\n\n<p>Huge props to Travis Chance on this one - I originally tested Test Runs here, but only in the context of a version that also ran Scavenge. That one was too slow for what I was trying to do, and I didn't really come back to them. Once I started thinking about them as Tinkering alternatives, rather than SMC alternatives (thanks to discussion with Travis), it clicked. Test Run here can sometimes tutor, sometimes Inside Job for a first turn Siphon, and sometimes recover from program trashing. Beware though and don't make the same mistake I did in the tourney - because there's only one Femme in the deck, inadvertently drawing it when you want to Test Run will delay you by an entire turn. One of the losses was actually caused by a stupidly played Diesel on click one of the game... which drew me the Femme. As a result, I couldn't test-siphon for the follow-up Indexing. Learn from my mistakes :)<\/p>\n\n<p>One of my favorite plays of the tournament involving Test-Running an Atman, then using Levy on the same turn. That way, the Atman was the top card of the deck after the reset, ready for deployment. <\/p>\n\n<p>Also, Test Run has CT on the illustration, so that's always a plus. <\/p>\n","username":"PeekaySK","cards":{"01007":1,"01018":3,"01026":1,"01034":3,"01041":1,"01044":1,"01050":3,"02007":1,"02009":3,"02046":1,"02047":2,"02066":1,"02106":3,"02107":2,"03035":1,"03038":3,"03040":1,"03043":1,"03046":2,"03052":3,"03054":3,"04067":1}},{"id":4182,"name":"Cerebral Hive of Giraffes (Chronos Bratislava First Place)","creation":"2014-04-13 17:02:12","description":"<p>Took 1st with this at our Chronos yesterday, went 5-0 in a field of 19 players from 3 countries (Slovakia, Austria, Hungary). Great fun was had by all!<\/p>\n\n<p>This deck is an evolution of my winning CI deck from the Vienna store champs (which should be listed under \"derived from\", unless I messed it up). If you're not familiar with how these decks work, check out that one's description first, I'll only cover the differences here. In general, the deck is pretty hard to stop unless you're both built with it in mind, and actually have a very good idea of how to stop it... and even then, you sort of need to have a bit of luck, because even the right moves can fail to pay out, and then you're just boned. In particular, once you have 4 points scored, even starting the turn at 0 credits, with a Source in play won't actually stop you from winning! That's pretty insane when you think about it. <\/p>\n\n<p>Since the Vienna SC, Double Time came out and became legal, and two things happened that turn CI into complete beast mode: <em>Reclamation Order<\/em> and <em>Hive<\/em>. <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Hive<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Hive is the bigger thing, as it fits perfectly with the CI gameplan. It's an incredibly taxing piece of ICE for all of the game except for the last 3 turns. First one goes on HQ, second one goes on Archives if you suspect Sneakdoor, RnD otherwise. The third one usually isn't worth installing, but you still need to run 3 copies, because you want to see the second one soon enough. <\/p>\n\n<p>Pretty much, unless your opponent is playing <em>Morning Star<\/em>, he's done going in on a regular basis. Losing a <em>Hive<\/em> to Parasite isn't such a huge deal, you just bring it right back. Femme is a non-issue due to the number of subs and Knight just cries bloody tears, plain and simple :P<\/p>\n\n<p>Because of Hive, you need to change your preferred order of agendas a bit - you want to score the PriReq last, because if you score it second, you turn off your Hives completely, instead of just dialing them back to Walls of Static. For this reason, the preferred solution is now to double-biotic an Efficiency Committee, then SfSS a second EffComm (keeping one token on the original), then spend a turn Reclaiming the Shipments (more on that later), and then finish with a PriReq. The good news about this order is that should your opponent manage to get a Source or Chakana online in between your second and third agendas, it won't do him any good (because of the spare token). <\/p>\n\n<p>To manage fitting in 3 copies of Hive, I had to cut the third Celebrity Gift and all Jacksons. There's a slight variation in ICE composition - Wotans had to go. Fortunately, they can all go now that <em>Reclamation Order<\/em> exists. Which brings me to...<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Reclamation Order<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>This card becomes completely insane if you have the handsize to keep the three copies you're reclaiming. In this deck, it's essentially a better version of a Jackson, because it recurs the stuff you need (I'm looking at you, Biotic Labor) straight to your hand instead of into your deck, where you have to fish for it. That becomes supremely worth the extra click and credit, and freeing up influence is also very welcome. <\/p>\n\n<p>Don't make the mistake of playing Reclamation Order and dropping Archived Memories for them, though - those two have very strong synergy. Reclaiming Archiveds is super-awesome for fixing any draw definiciencies you may be experiencing, and if you keep the third Archived as backup, you can use it to... reclaim the Reclamation Order :D One of the plays I kept making throughout the tournament was to just take turns of  \"Archived Memories for Celebrity Gift, play CG for 7 credits, go, which is basically an unstoppable version of having a Melange out. In a deck that just needs a huge bank to make all its plays, this is obviously very strong. <\/p>\n\n<p>The other main uses of Reclamation Order are:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Grab back Biotics you used for the first score (thus allowing you to bypass that pesky Source dude)<\/li>\n<li>Grab back Shipments from SanSan you used for the second score (thus allowing you to make the second score another EffComm, which is supremely useful)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Other than that, you can use them to take whichever econ card you happened to draw all three copies of early (Blue-Level Clearance is best for this, but both Restructure and Hedge Fund work very well too), and possibly even salvage some especially disastrous Noise mills :P<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Green Level Clearance becomes Subliminal Messaging<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>This is the final touch, and in retrospect should have been pretty obvious beforehand, as well. Green level nets you 2 credits and a card. If you play Subliminal instead, you can spend the click you're not paying for the play drawing, and you're just one credit short. If the runner fails to make a run on even one of his turns, you're on par with GLC. Add to that the extra utility of padding your hand with multiple copies that bounced back (which you can actually hold over multiple turns, unlike other Corp identities) and the choice becomes clear. <\/p>\n\n<p>(oh, and it enables the \"score a 6-advance agenda from 0 credits\" situation I mentioned in the first paragraph, that's how awesome Subliminal really is).<\/p>\n\n<p>So yeah, there's my corp deck... enjoy it while you can, I have a strong feeling something in H&amp;P will come out that will screw this over pretty hard :)<\/p>\n","username":"PeekaySK","cards":{"01058":3,"01059":3,"01062":3,"01064":1,"01106":3,"01110":3,"02051":3,"02110":3,"03001":1,"03005":3,"03019":3,"03027":1,"04012":2,"04034":3,"04040":3,"04090":3,"04100":3,"04111":3,"04117":3}},{"id":4183,"name":"Gabe Trial Deck 4.13.14","creation":"2014-04-13 17:42:09","description":"<p>So far I have not played this deck out too much, but it has shown quite a winning-streak when I do..<\/p>\n","username":"Tink0822","cards":{"01007":1,"01008":1,"01013":1,"01017":1,"01018":2,"01019":2,"01020":2,"01021":2,"01022":2,"01024":1,"01025":2,"01026":1,"01027":2,"01028":2,"01029":2,"01030":1,"01031":1,"01032":2,"01049":2,"01051":1,"02104":2,"02105":2,"02109":1,"03032":1,"03044":1,"03049":1,"03052":1,"03053":1,"03055":1,"04104":1,"04105":1,"04106":2}},{"id":4184,"name":"HB Nothing Special","creation":"2014-04-13 18:44:04","description":"<p>Plain old HB fast advance, updated for new cards.

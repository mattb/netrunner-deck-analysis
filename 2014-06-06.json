Using <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01067\">Jinteki: Personal Evolution<\/a> means that the runner must always have a card in hand to score an agenda, which combos well with <a href=\"\/en\/card\/05017\">Komainu<\/a>. A great first turn play is <a href=\"\/en\/card\/05017\">Komainu<\/a>, agenda, <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01110\">Hedge Fund<\/a>. If they run, they will lose their hand and then have to jack out because a stolen agenda would end the game. If they don't run, you can quickly score the agenda. This combination is so mean that you'll find that once they know you can do this they might not run, allowing you to bluff with another ICE.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"\/en\/card\/01072\">Neural EMP<\/a> and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04079\">Punitive Counterstrike<\/a> raise the threshold for a safe run for the runner; e.g. if you have <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04079\">Punitive Counterstrike<\/a> in hand, they must have at least 4 cards in hand between running and the end of the turn to safely steal <a href=\"\/en\/card\/05007\">The Future Perfect<\/a>. <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02032\">Fetal AI<\/a> is even tougher to steal. <a href=\"\/en\/card\/05013\">Cerebral Cast<\/a> can lead to <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01099\">Scorched Earth<\/a> unless they are willing to take a brain damage, which would make the flat-line threat greater.<\/p>\n\n<p>The ICE in the deck is mainly economical, taxing type ice that will cost the runner even if they have the right icebreaker. Sure, they can pay clicks or credits to get through, but do they have enough cards to survive <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02032\">Fetal AI<\/a> or <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01069\">Project Junebug<\/a> backed up with kill cards on the following Corp turn?<\/p>\n\n<p>Like other Jinteki decks, this deck is very strong against criminal or basically any fast runner deck with a poor late game. <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04073\">Shock!<\/a> and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01070\">Snare!<\/a> with all of the damage cards shut down decks that need to hit central servers hard.

I'll be tweaking it for sure and appreciate feedback. It's inspired by my new favorite agenda\u2014House of Knives. It brought me back to PE Jinteki.<\/p>\n\n<p>The goal is to score House of Knives as soon as possible. When that's scored it is just about getting\/making the opportunity to flatline the runner. This is hard of course, but even if I don't get the chance, having it on the table normally slows a runner enough  to give me the chance to score agendas for the win.  The Snares! and Shocks will also slow them down as they re-fill their hand. <\/p>\n\n<p>Caprice is there to help in the remotes to try to score in those moments when the flatline is unlikely. The one Cerebral is there mostly as a bluff so I can install, advance, advance and scare the runner. Even if it is trashed they don't know I'm running only one copy.<\/p>\n\n<p>Normally I put  Hokusai Grids in the central servers, wherever they are more likely to run, it will definitely give runners a difficult decision if house of knives is scored. <\/p>\n\n<p>The best way to make the flatline happen is to corporate troubleshoot a Komainu or lay down a Inazuma into Komainu. Corporate trouble shooting Inazuma is also an option. These normally go in a central, but if scoring out of remotes is necessary because a House of Knives wasn't scored, that can work.<\/p>\n\n<p>It's a fun little combo to pull off.<\/p>\n\n<p>\"And then at that point Billy, your house started to shake, the heavens opened up ...\" (Favorite quote from The Rock)<\/p>\n\n<p>This wipes the hand out leaving the rest for House of Knives or Emp.<\/p>\n\n<p>Throwing in two shocks and a Fetal AI makes Susanoo dangerous and potentially a way to flatline in archives.<\/p>\n\n<p>Private Contracts are there to recover from the Account Siphons, a weakness with my porous ice. The other weakness is Parasite recursion, but thankfully you aren't too worried about shutting them out.<\/p>\n\n<p>It has been fun to play and I'll be tweaking it for some time to see if my flatline percentage goes up. <\/p>\n","username":"vdude","cards":{"01065":2,"01067":1,"01070":3,"01072":2,"01110":3,"02015":2,"02032":3,"02059":3,"02095":2,"03009":1,"04012":3,"04033":1,"04073":2,"04076":3,"04093":2,"04114":2,"05004":3,"05006":1,"05007":3,"05016":2,"05017":2,"05018":3,"05020":1}},{"id":6473,"name":"Jinteki big decision rush","creation":"2014-06-06 21:24:23","description":"<p>Cerebral overwriter or even just junebug could be the trap? maybe.<\/p>\n\n<p>Hive is super taxing, 1 research is just a fourth econ for turn 1, you dont want to give them money often.

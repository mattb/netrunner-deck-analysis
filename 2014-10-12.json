Drawing into your Magnum Opus is perfection, but tutoring for it with an early SMC\/Test Run is hardly ever a bad move (you can always clone that SMC back later). In fact I usually dedicate my first SMC to making sure Mopus hits the table; not only does it set up a devastating economic potential, but it's your Scorch\/Midseasons protection in a deck that just doesn't have time for Plascrete. That makes it all the more important to realize the healthy mix of blazing speed you can achieve needs to be tempered with economic patience. The more money you have, the less the corp can do to you. There are usually one or two money-making turns you should be able to identify in most games, wherein you should feel comfortable letting off server pressure and clicking Mopus for 8 credits; in much the same way corps identify scoring windows, your win rate with this deck will skyrocket when you can start to identify economy windows.<\/p>\n\n<p>You can look at dropping the second copy of Magnum Opus if you're dead set on making the 45 card limit, but an early Replicator will easily thin anywhere between 6 and 8 cards from your deck, so this build plays much tighter than you'd think. I'll be adding 2 Astrolabes once Up &amp; Over drops, and I doubt I'll cut anything to do so. This deck can also run a one-off Deus X or Sharpshooter if you want it to, but I personally favor patient play over the silver bullets.

Main idea behind the deck is to combine the work compression that Jinteki PE does so well with the FA goodness coming out of NBN. It tries to create really early game pressure which forces the runner to run aggressively and punishes them if they aren't careful or slow down.<\/p>\n\n<p>Core concept of the deck is to outpace the runner and rush out 7 agenda points really quickly, but unlike Astrobiotics which tries to speed things up on the Corp side with Biotic Labors, this deck uses Snares, Psychic Fields and Scorched Earth to tries to slow the Runner down. NEH is perfect for some shell game shenanigans because of the extra draw power you get from the ID. I've often found that a successful Psychic Field or Snare landing on the Runner can create the scoring window for an ASPP.<\/p>\n\n<p>I still think I need to learn how to shell game properly to make this deck work better, but I've been doing pretty well with it so far in testing and games nights. The way I'm piloting it now, I can probably get a win in 80% of the time. Out of those wins, I'd say half are won through scoring 7 points and the other half are won through flatline. One of my favourite plays is to leave a Breaking News unprotected in a remote, wait until the runner hits a Snare or Psychic Field and score off the BN and land a Scorched Earth on my turn.<\/p>\n","username":"squashed","cards":{"01070":3,"01081":3,"01082":2,"01083":3,"01092":3,"01099":2,"01110":3,"02056":3,"02115":3,"04015":3,"04059":3,"04076":3,"04096":3,"04119":3,"04120":3,"05010":3,"05027":3,"06005":1}},{"id":9671,"name":"Silhoette Suppling Power","creation":"2014-10-12 10:07:21","description":"<p>No real tricks just lots of access and cheaper resources\/hardware thanks to the supplier.<\/p>\n\n<p>I have enjoyed using this deck and playing as sil so far the only problem i've found is somethings getting all the breakers crypsis helps but i think i may need another special order for the deck.<\/p>\n\n<p>i've always liked expose but i find i can't justify the deck slot for it sil fix's this though.

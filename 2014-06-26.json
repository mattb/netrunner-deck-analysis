This ain't it. If you want to make a proper server like a real man, read on!<\/p>\n\n<p>The game plan is pretty straightforward: seal up centrals with a mix of gear-check and destroyers (Grim is particularly good on Archives). This creates scoring windows, both immediate (he can't get in, score now!) and delayed (too risky, just save the Tennin token for using <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02033\">Trick of Light<\/a> later). <\/p>\n\n<p>If you played any Supermodernism variant, this tends to play similarly - you need to rush out agendas behind 2 pieces of ICE, or at least install them so that they can get the Tennin token. Most of the time, the correct play is to install, but not advance. If you don't get a Tennin token, leave the card alone - your opponent won't know whether it's an agenda, a Caprice, or something else (this works even better in a variant of this deck that runs 2 less pieces of ICE in favor of two Snares). If you do get one, you can do a lot of crazy things - especially if that agenda was <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04053\">Unorthodox Predictions<\/a>. You can easily chain UP into a once-advanced Nisei Mk.II, which means you can keep chaining them next turn as well. Hell, you can even go UP -> Future Perfect, for a 4-point grab just with one <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02033\">Trick of Light<\/a>. Play around with this agenda setup, you'll find it has a <em>lot<\/em> of flexibility in terms of how your scoring outs look. <\/p>\n\n<p>The question that tends to get asked often is: <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Why not RP?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>And my answer to that is, because Tennin enables more interesting plays with regards to scoring agendas. <\/p>\n\n<p>It lends itself particularly well to a Never-Advance style of play: if you already have an agenda down when you get a Tennin token, it's like getting handed a Biotic Labor and 5 credits. This is <strong>not<\/strong> to be underestimated, and unlocks plays (over multiple turns, even) that aren't available (or practical) in other Jinteki identities. <\/p>\n\n<p>Other than that, the rest should be pretty self-explanatory. Oh, one more comment: if you're looking at the <a href=\"\/en\/card\/03014\">Successful Demonstration<\/a>s and thinking about changing them into <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04015\">Jackson Howard<\/a>, don't.

Basically, throw out your programs with Inject and Freelance Coding Contract, then install them for free with Retrieval Run.  Now your archives is a toolbox, and you can get your big breakers for free.  Logos will let you get some extra cards so you don't lose everything to a Coding Contract, and help you find what you need (though it could easily be either a Grimoire or Deep Red).  <\/p>\n","username":"skydivingninja","cards":{"01002":3,"01008":2,"01010":2,"01012":3,"01050":3,"02003":3,"02004":1,"02041":1,"02087":2,"02101":3,"03033":2,"03054":3,"04002":3,"04003":3,"04021":2,"04041":1,"04043":2,"04047":1,"04065":1,"05037":2,"06073":3}},{"id":7147,"name":"Upstalk\/Scorched","creation":"2014-06-26 16:36:59","description":"\n","username":"Axlotl","cards":{"01086":2,"01093":1,"01094":3,"01098":3,"01099":3,"01101":2,"01103":3,"01104":2,"01107":2,"01110":3,"02018":3,"02019":2,"02070":3,"02077":1,"02120":1,"04015":3,"04040":3,"04098":2,"04110":2,"04117":2,"05014":1,"06009":2,"06012":1}},{"id":7148,"name":"Weyland Root Glacier","creation":"2014-06-26 16:47:48","description":"\n","username":"Axlotl","cards":{"01090":2,"01093":1,"01098":3,"01100":3,"01101":1,"01102":3,"01103":3,"01110":3,"02018":3,"02019":2,"02058":3,"02077":2,"02120":1,"04015":3,"04040":3,"04078":1,"04111":2,"04117":1,"04119":3,"05020":1,"06003":1,"06008":3,"06009":2}},{"id":7149,"name":"Demolition Man 1.5","creation":"2014-06-26 16:57:53","description":"\n","username":"Oathwood","cards":{"01001":1,"01002":3,"01003":2,"01006":2,"01007":1,"01008":3,"01010":1,"01012":3,"01018":3,"01050":3,"01051":3,"01053":3,"02003":2,"02009":2,"02041":1,"02087":3,"03052":3,"03054":3,"04043":3,"04082":1}},{"id":7150,"name":"Dedicated Responses in a Team Formation","creation":"2014-06-26 17:49:10","description":"\n","username":"e1337pete","cards":{"01081":3,"01082":2,"01086":1,"01088":3,"01092":2,"01099":2,"01109":3,"01110":3,"01112":2,"01113":2,"02056":3,"02097":3,"02115":3,"02117":1,"02118":3,"04015":3,"04076":3,"04077":3,"04096":1,"04119":3,"06005":1}},{"id":7151,"name":"War Reporting","creation":"2014-06-26 18:38:13","description":"<p>Created as a challenge to make an NBN deck using only 1 core set and the first data pack.<\/p>\n","username":"imp","cards":{"01080":1,"01081":2,"01082":1,"01083":2,"01084":2,"01086":2,"01087":2,"01088":2,"01090":2,"01091":2,"01092":1,"01098":3,"01099":2,"01107":3,"01109":3,"01110":3,"01111":3,"01112":2,"01113":2,"02013":2,"02016":3,"02017":3,"02020":2}},{"id":7152,"name":"Andromeda (Regional, Vienna 21.06.2014)","creation":"2014-06-26 18:47:54","description":"\n","username":"Korrigan","cards":{"01002":1,"01007":1,"01008":3,"01012":2,"01014":1,"01018":3,"01021":2,"01022":3,"01024":2,"01026":1,"01050":3,"02006":1,"02009":3,"02043":2,"02083":1,"02091":2,"02104":3,"02106":1,"03052":2,"03054":3,"05035":2,"05036":1,"05041":1,"05048":2}},{"id":7153,"name":"NBN: MN (Regional, Vienna 21.06.2014)","creation":"2014-06-26 18:51:44","description":"\n","username":"Korrigan","cards":{"01080":1,"01081":3,"01082":2,"01084":1,"01088":1,"01090":2,"01092":2,"01099":3,"01107":1,"01110":3,"01111":1,"02020":2,"02052":1,"02056":3,"02110":1,"02115":3,"02116":2,"03026":1,"04015":3,"04033":1,"04040":2,"04076":3,"04096":2,"04119":2,"05024":2,"05027":2}},{"id":7154,"name":"Corporate Sponsorship","creation":"2014-06-26 19:10:39","description":"<p>The goal of this deck is to run broke, and then use credits gained from the corp rezzing ice to install programs and hardware, as well as pay for using icebreakers if necessary.  There is a lot of recurring credits available to pay for icebreakers, so the intent is to have that available if needed.  In the ideal play, the corp is effectively paying you to get your rig out.<\/p>\n\n<p>The early game 'engine' for this deck revolves around Personal Workshop, and installing programs and hardware on it.  Prior to a run you dump all your credits into installing cards\/play events\/etc. and use whatever remains to pull power counters off of items on your Personal Workshop(s).  Then you pick a server and run, hopefully forcing the corp to rez ice to stop you (otherwise you get free access).  The credits from that rez should hopefully provide enough econ for you pull out the necessary icebreaker, break through the ice, and continue (ditching any remaining credits if necessary by pulling counters off of personal workshop).<\/p>\n\n<p>For expensive ice, Crescentus (recurred with clone chip if necessary) can be used to derez for a potential twofer down the road.<\/p>\n\n<p>Icebreakers were largely chosen because of their low cost to install\/use.  Overmind is there for the early game prior to getting the whole rig out.  Deus X is there for the emergency situation (either scary ice or June Bugs, Snares, etc.).<\/p>\n\n<p>I think the remaining cards are fairly self explanatory and mostly synergistic.  I decided to have a small drip economy since there is a lot of link in this deck (to reduce the tag and bag threat) and some money available at the beginning of each turn to get some cards installed could be very helpful.<\/p>\n","username":"Castings","cards":{"01005":3,"01007":1,"01008":3,"01014":1,"01034":3,"01041":2,"02008":3,"02025":3,"02028":3,"02047":3,"02049":3,"02065":3,"02066":2,"02069":3,"03038":3,"03039":3,"03041":3,"03042":1,"03046":3,"05053":2,"06017":1,"06018":3}},{"id":7155,"name":"Parakate","creation":"2014-06-26 19:35:38","description":"\n","username":"guinea_pig","cards":{"01008":3,"01012":3,"01026":1,"01033":1,"01034":3,"01038":2,"01050":3,"01053":2,"02027":1,"02047":2,"02091":3,"02106":2,"03034":3,"03035":1,"03038":3,"03040":3,"03044":1,"03052":3,"03053":3,"04043":2,"05033":1}},{"id":7156,"name":"House of Brains","creation":"2014-06-26 19:39:44","description":"\n","username":"guinea_pig","cards":{"01061":1,"01067":1,"01101":2,"01108":2,"01109":2,"01110":3,"02014":1,"02032":3,"02070":1,"02110":2,"02112":1,"03009":1,"03023":1,"04032":3,"04039":3,"04071":2,"04073":3,"04093":2,"05004":3,"05006":1,"05011":2,"05014":2,"05016":2,"05017":2,"05018":2,"05020":1,"05022":1}},{"id":7157,"name":"Biding Time","creation":"2014-06-26 20:12:15","description":"<p>Experimental big rig deck.

But it takes time and make the runner spend a lot of ressources on breaking subs.<br>With that in mind, I decided to find a way to lower the cash needed for such a rig while keeping the possibility for early pressure. <br>Hostage is here for multiple reasons, the first being all the ressources we need are connections and the second it trades influence for deckspace that we use on hardware. With that many, you want Inside Man ASAP, period. This is definitely your first hostage play if you don't have it in hand.<br>The second card you're looking for is Replicator. While not being mandatory for the deck to work, it will boost your installation so much you will want it each game. Diesel is here to help you on that quest. <br>Tinkering and Stimhack are here for early aggression. While installing your hardwares and programs you have Deus X\/Faerie to fight big ices, Snare! and the like.  <br>You want at least 2 Cyberfeeder, 1-2 Cloak and Corroder or Guardian Blade on Omni-Drive for a total of 5 free credits to use in one turn. Avoid installing more than 2 Cloak for MU issues unless you have preemptively installed all your MU cards (7 total). <br>I decided not to play The Toolbox to avoid problem with cash as I have no way to gain them back quikly. <br>The installation of hardwares and programs is very dependant on the cost. Try to use Kate ability properly, in addition to Inside Man\/Modded. <br><br>As the game progress, you will be able to do at least a discounted run a turn and that is when John Masanori and Kati Jones should be installed. While competing for the last Agenda Points, you should find them in R&D using the interfaces.","username":"NetEldrogo","cards":{"01004":1,"01005":3,"01007":1,"01033":1,"01034":3,"01035":2,"01037":3,"01038":2,"01043":1,"01050":3,"02009":2,"02066":1,"02068":1,"02088":3,"02091":1,"02104":1,"02107":2,"03038":3,"03039":1,"03041":3,"03042":1,"03046":3,"04004":3,"04009":1}},{"id":653,"name":"Chaos Central","creation":"2013-11-25 12:24:15","description":"This just has soo many bits to put in place it's only won one game so far.

IoP is essentially unavoidable damage. With shaper and criminal being the most common meta (OK...mostly criminal) this operation just hurts them badly. Maybe giving you enough time to advance an agenda. The idea is to hurt them but if you get lucky and trash everything a neural Welp can flat line them.

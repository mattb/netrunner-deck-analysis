Imagine using Self-modifying Code to search a C\u00e4issa during a Run, while you have Deep Red installed. Or recovering one from the Heap with Clone-Chip mid-run. <br><br>Search, install and move. All at once, no need for Clicks. <br><br>This deck is obviously in an early-alpha stage as it is, but I think there's a huge potential here. The idea behind the single R&D \/ HQ Interface and Record Reconstructor is to raise the pressure bar on the central servers. <br><br>Economy is Kate + Modded + low costs + Professional Contacts efficiency + ... you get the picture. <br><br>Public Sympathy because I love that card, but you might wanna swap it for a couple Plascrete, for example. <br><br>Oh and of course a single Mimic for Swordsman.","username":"paddosan","cards":{"01011":1,"01033":1,"01034":2,"01035":2,"01050":3,"01051":2,"02047":2,"02050":2,"02085":1,"02091":2,"02107":1,"03031":1,"03035":1,"03038":3,"03040":2,"03046":2,"03049":3,"03052":3,"03053":3,"04002":2,"04003":2,"04028":1,"04042":2,"04043":2}},{"id":657,"name":"Jinteki Run to me 2.0","creation":"2013-11-26 06:28:20","description":"","username":"araksna","cards":{"01068":3,"01070":3,"01071":2,"01073":2,"01079":2,"01089":3,"01098":3,"01103":3,"01110":3,"01111":3,"01113":3,"02014":3,"02031":1,"02032":3,"02033":2,"02070":3,"02095":1,"02113":1,"03023":1,"04032":3,"04033":3,"04040":3}},{"id":658,"name":"Kate Where am I?","creation":"2013-11-26 06:41:08","description":"","username":"araksna","cards":{"01008":3,"01014":1,"01019":2,"01024":2,"01025":1,"01033":1,"01034":3,"01035":3,"01036":3,"01037":2,"01038":2,"01043":2,"01046":2,"01049":3,"01050":3,"02091":3,"02107":3,"03040":3,"03046":2,"03048":2,"03049":3,"04025":2}},{"id":659,"name":"Weyland Mills Agenda 1.0","creation":"2013-11-26 06:58:10","description":"","username":"araksna","cards":{"01070":2,"01083":2,"01089":2,"01091":1,"01093":1,"01094":3,"01098":3,"01100":3,"01103":3,"01104":2,"01110":3,"01111":3,"01113":2,"02018":3,"02060":3,"02070":3,"02077":1,"02120":1,"03026":2,"04017":3,"04020":3,"04037":3,"04039":2}},{"id":660,"name":"Reina of Destruction vHJ.1","creation":"2013-11-26 15:15:50","description":"I've decided to publish this build for ideas.

I tried to fit in a Xanadu but couldnt. With the targeted destruction theme, Took can force the Corp to choose to leave the ice or trash it. In any case, It may be the difference between encountering certain ice or more than one per turn.

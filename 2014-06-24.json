Once MO is out, Sharpshooter allows you to be incredibly aggressive while you wait for them to make you get a rig. By this time you've scored 1-4 points and trashed some of their economy.

I would just put out as many assets as possible each turn, advancing here and there depending on the situation and of course having the runner screw himself over if he hits the wrong server or if he decides to play safe and only run R&amp;D, scoring all the tasty agenda points the very next turn. The one big problem I could see this deck facing is money. Kinteki generally doesn't have endless funds to play with, but I fill there is even more of a lack of income here because of the reduced operations. I do have some money makers in there that double as funds denial for others if they do trash them due to being higher on the trash cost side, but criminal decks would probably just laugh at my measly 4-5 trash costs and destroy all the servers.<\/p>\n\n<p>Any advice\/criticism\/slaps in the face are welcome!

That's 2 MU.<\/p>\n\n<p>Magnum is there to fuel other cards as an early-mid game bank, taking up 2 MU while it's out (hopefully trashed to Aesop's or with Scavenge to grab a trashed breaker.)<\/p>\n\n<p>Net Shield is to be used when necessary (a must have against Jinteki), though it can still protect against nasty Snares!. Omni-Drive hosting Net Shield means its a discounted net damage prevention each turn that doesn't affect my MU.<\/p>\n\n<p>Paricia's simple existence is to help eliminate the all-important Assets that aid the Corp. Particularly effective vs Asset-reliant decks, though it'll often take up an MU, so it can become Aesop fodder once I'm comfortable that Assets have been cleaned up.<\/p>\n\n<p>Breakers are selected for efficiency and power. I can host either Battering Ram OR Garrote for a nicely pumped breaker (5 STR, 4 STR respectively), selecting whichever would suit me better depending on the corp's ice. Oftentimes it'll be Garrote for Jinteki \/ Tag'n'bag and Battering Ram for glaciers \/ Bioroid (pesky barrieroids!). This saves me 2 MU, which is fantastic.<\/p>\n\n<p>Torch is a stand alone powerhouse, capable of turning any Code Gates into ash with ease. I'll attempt to host it onto Omni-Drive, freeing up an MU and letting me add fuel to Torch every turn.<\/p>\n\n<p>With all programs out and properly tricked out, I'm using 2 MU from Garrote or Battering Ram, 1 MU per Hemorrhage (up to 3), after I'm done with Paricia and Magnum. In short, this deck should never have MU issues, card order willing.<\/p>\n\n<p>Test Run \/ Scavenge is the easiest way to get my Torch and Garrote going (or Battering, depending on the situation), but should they not emerge, I'll have to rely on Kati stockpile and Personal Workshop to get things paid for, though I'd rather save Kati for when my breakers are up and running and I'm ready to smash through everything.<\/p>\n\n<p>Clone Chips help keep me safe from Program trashing (though most semi-advanced remotes should be run, the most dangerous being Junebug). Borrowed Satellite help ensure my Diesel \/ QT usage isn't wasted, and mitigates Brain Damage \/ Trace \/ Scorched effectiveness.<\/p>\n\n<p>Aesop's is mainly there to clean up the field once I don't need PW (also eats up additional ones that pop up for 2 credits), get an extra credit for DC, get income tax on Kati once she's done, and even eat up Paricia \/ unused Clone Chips.<\/p>\n\n<p>Last but not least, the star of the show. Woman in the Red Dress plays a special role in tandem with Hemorrhage. Let's say the card is an Agenda. Corp keeps it there. They draw that Agenda, and now I know I can attack HQ with a chance at an Agenda. If I have 2 or 4 virus counters, I can use them. Now the Corp must decide; get rid of other valuable cards (ops, assets) or keep the Agenda in hand? If they trash the Agenda, they have to protect Archives, causing them to use more ice. If they don't, they lose another card and still worry about HQ (which normally isn't the case against Shapers).\nIf they draw the Agenda, I know its there, and they're drawing another card, getting them closer to milling, and potentially drawing another Agenda, making HQ a nice target. Paricia plays a nice role in wiping away assets they draw in the process.<\/p>\n\n<p>This deck aims to threaten all centrals on a more subtle scale, forcing the corp to divide their efforts actively or risk losing Agendas in a flash.<\/p>\n\n<p>I've played one game so far with a deck similar to this (made modifications after seeing its weaknesses), though I feel this one should do quite well. The biggest enemy (as always) is starting hands, but each card serves a purpose, let's just hope we get at least one econ card in starting (Magnum, Kati, Personal Workshop), for they'll keep us going.<\/p>\n\n<p>I'll update this as I play matches!

All the other events are economy.<\/p>\n\n<p>HARDWARE - Obligatory Plascretes to avoid Scorched BS, and a lot of economy hardware ie. recurring credits to use on icebreakers. Personal Touch is a big deal when using only fixed strength breakers.<\/p>\n\n<p>RESOURCE - Kati is great because of the way the deck plays (when you can't get in anymore, you spend 5-6 turns just drawing and clicking like crazy to get the cards\/money you need). ProCon works into this plan well as well, and Ice Carver again is great with fixed strength breakers.<\/p>\n\n<p>ICEBREAKERS - All the fixed strength Anarch breakers. Costly to set up, but very efficient. The deck relies entirely of drawing at least one copy of these.<\/p>\n\n<p>PROGRAMS - All ice debuff programs. Parasite is very useful early game (especially combined with Ice Carver and Datasuckers).<\/p>\n\n<p>The main issues are: \n- Big traces on runs (or traces on upgrades like Ash) causing brain damage - this is mostly a problem since once the rig is set up you will not have that much money to beat these traces.  Note that Spinal Modem will ONLY give you brain damage on trace DURING A RUN, not any trace.\n- Big ICE that will be difficult to reduce to breakable range.\n- And most importantly, not drawing the cards you need when you draw (that Anarch RNG).<\/p>\n\n<p>Originally the deck was with Reina, but the Whizzard ability serves to keep the Corp poorer early on (don't want to put down unprotected assets) as well as allowing me to be more aggressive (trashing R&amp;D cards early). Also trashing Jacksons for nothing makes you feel warm and fuzzy.<\/p>\n\n<p>Drawing is kind of a problem in Anarchs, but I find between Professional Contacts, Express Delivery and a little luck, I can get what I want reasonably quickly - the issue is then getting the money up over 3-4 turns (usually Katie) to do with before the corp just wins. If I get set up quickly and the Corp doesn't have any big ICE, then I usually end up running 3-4 times a turn for basically nothing.<\/p>\n\n<p>A good opening hand will have 2-3 economy cards (Sure Gamble\/Kati\/ProCon\/Modded) and a Datasucker\/Parasite.<\/p>\n\n<p>The deck is slightly limited as I am missing 4 datapacks from Genesis, but it has done well for me regardless.

It also requires you to be pretty good at bluffing and generally doing irrational YOLO-type plays.<\/p>\n\n<p>The primary mode of winning for this deck is advancing agendas put down the previous turn. Alternatively a runner could flatline himself early on by facechecking ICE and running into a snare\/shock\/agenda.<\/p>\n\n<p>The strength of the deck is information control. The runner won't want to be running on low cards because of the identity ability, Snares and Shocks... but they also don't want to hit a Psychic Field with 5+ cards in their hand either. Sweet sweet douchery.<\/p>\n\n<p>AGENDAS - Most of the agendas in here are 1 or 2pt agendas, as this maxes the benefit of the ID. The only 4\/2 agenda is Medical Breakthrough, as it reduces its cost when scored (thus I don't mind so much when it is stolen early) and you can fast advance the last one.\nGila Hands Archology is also decent economy, which the deck needs quite a lot.\nI have won a few games by scoring a Philotic Entanglement against a runner with 5 agendas in his pool. You can't rely on it in any way, but is super douchy\/rewarding when it happens.<\/p>\n\n<p>ASSETS - Most of the assets are non-advanceable traps (Psych Field, Shock, Snare) with 2 non-trap assets: Isabel McGuire (used to return failed traps to hand, forcing people to spend money to trash shocks and Psychic Fields) and Zaibatsu Loyalty (to help against expose effects). Both have respectable thrash costs so I don't mind losing them too much.<\/p>\n\n<p>ICE - Most of the ICE is quite porous and is really only useful early game to deal as much damage as possible in that timeframe (Archer is the exception). Ideally you want a Komainu on HQ and R&amp;D, and the other ICE can go anywhere depending on your opponent - it is rare to go deep on any server.\nYou can switch the ICE around at will, but essentially you want Komainus and Data Mines, a few big \"surprise\" damaging ICE like Archer or Janus 1.0, and then some cheap taxing ICE.<\/p>\n\n<p>OPERATIONS - Most operations are low-level money cards since most times the deck is pretty low on money from advancing and paying for traps. Shipments from Mirrormorph give good click economy if they show up (usually use them to install an agenda and 2 traps).\nI thought about Celebrity Gift for a while, but given the deck's reliance on obscuring information, I found I didn't want to expose my hand most of the time.<\/p>\n\n<p>The best opening hand is one or two pieces of ICE (preferably a Komainu\/Katana), a trap or two, an agenda and an operation of some form.<\/p>\n\n<p>Good counters against it include Net Shield or Feedback Filter + heaps of cash generation, Levy AR, Deus Ex + Clone Chips, or tons of expose. It is a really fun deck to play if you're into being a total douche and making your opponent suffer, although it gets shut down pretty hard by a few cards which prevent net damage and deck attrition.<\/p>\n\n<p>Changes would probably revolve around modifying the ICE around a bit to suit your preferences, and possibly changing the agenda composition a bit. I have considered an alternate, slightly douchier slant on this deck that runs Profiteering and generates tons of bad pub and money in the mid game to rez surprise monster ICE (ie.Susanoo, Janus,) that cost lots to break + another Snare.<\/p>\n","username":"Yertle4","cards":{"01060":2,"01067":1,"01070":2,"01071":2,"01076":3,"01077":2,"01098":3,"01101":2,"01110":2,"02014":2,"03023":3,"04033":1,"04050":2,"04053":2,"04073":2,"04093":1,"04096":2,"04100":2,"05004":3,"05005":3,"05006":1,"05010":3,"05017":3,"05026":1}},{"id":7989,"name":"Child's Play","creation":"2014-07-27 21:22:17","description":"<p><a href=\"\/en\/card\/05053\">Overmind<\/a> is the primary breaker for this set up. <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02046\">Chaos Theory: W\u00fcnderkind<\/a>'s +1 MU will help make this more tenable. <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01039\">Rabbit Hole<\/a> and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/03050\">Borrowed Satellite<\/a> will give a boost to link, making <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02089\">Creeper<\/a> and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02007\">ZU.13 Key Master<\/a> take up no MUs.

Mastery of this coupled with shaper ability to tutor exactly the answer they need on demand makes him a huge force to be reckoned with.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Whats seemingly a standard of Nasir decks are their usage of personal workshops as a way to dump economy in a useful way after the corp rezzes an approached ice. This strategy hastens the building of an expensive rig very quickly as now runs on an entirely unrezzed server are generating useful economy in addition to gathering information and costing the corp. Often Ill run with 0 credits on an unrezzed server to provoke the rez and earn economy or gain a free card access.  <\/p>\n\n<p>What's unique to this build is the focus on link paired with underworld contacts as a drip economy making sure that you always starts his turn with enough to trigger a quality time or even threaten the corp on click one. This frees you from having to click for economy and allows you more focus on setting up your workshops and making runs. Daily casts is also wonderful here as a way in the early game to get rid of your 3 credits before a run on an unrezzed server and make certain your economy doesnt suffer from a poorly timed facecheck of a popup window.  <\/p>\n\n<p>I've also chosen to forego plascretes in favor of high link and imp which can trash key punishing cards such as scorched earth and midseasons. Imp can then be recurred on demand by clone chips and scavenges. As for ice that's abit too pricey to break frequently, there are femmes with enough recursion and scavenges to make certain they go where you want them to be when you need it. Parasites handle pesky cheap ice, sometimes before you even have to trigger the encounter, a great way to handle popup windows and rototurrets. If you've just cashed in your kati and a ice wall is about to make you lose all your economy, a femme can save your economy by bypassing the ice instead of encounter and then scavenges can put the femme in a more useful position again.   <\/p>\n\n<h3>Other tweaks &amp; variants<\/h3>\n\n<p>I originally was testing out spinal modem as a way to speed up the aggression of the deck more, they work fantastically but I'm now at the step where I'm testing toolbox instead while I use that influence on the hostages to ensure I get my kati jones and drip economy setup earlier than later.

Named for Hearst's brand of Journalism, which I believe NBN holds dear to its heart, this is all about getting your opponent to make decisions to hurt themselves economically. If they don't you should be up above 30 credits by the end of the game.<\/p>\n\n<p>Central servers are usually a combination of tollbooth, enigma, inazuma, &amp; wraparound. Maybe rototurret out there too.<\/p>\n\n<p>Eli &amp; Heimdall are for your scoring remote. Inazuma is also good here, as well as tollbooth and roto if you have to. Even ignma isn't horrible if your opponent isn't playing yog.<\/p>\n\n<p>Focus on getting your economy going early game and setting up taxing centrals, while slowly building a remote. Drop Midway\/Ash into the remote and start scoring agendas off of your passive economy. Use the operational economy to gain a solid lead in the early game and solidify turns where you're dropping ice deep into an already tall server.<\/p>\n\n<p>Jackson, Corporate Shuffle, &amp; Executive Retreat should be used to reset hands that are too full of agendas. It's important not to let legwork knock you out of a game by being aware of when your hand has too many points.<\/p>\n\n<p>At the same time, if HQ isn't letting people in, then holding agendas isn't horrible; just make sure you're actually comfortable with it.<\/p>\n\n<p>This is one of the richest decks I've ever played and it wins more often than not. I'm not sure if it's a great deck, but it's a huge pain to deal with. The low agenda density leaves people hitting R&amp;D without much success.<\/p>\n\n<p>If you want to go even harder on the low agenda density, lose 2 NAPDs and gain a Pri Req. With the extra slot you can get a little more ice in the deck or take in another restructure.<\/p>\n\n<p>Hope you enjoy this as much as I do. Now go start inventing wars for people to fight and saying whatever you want about people.

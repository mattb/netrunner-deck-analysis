The MVP of the deck is certainly Shipment from SanSan. Saving two credits may not seem like a lot, but it can be the difference between life and death.  Once one Autoscript is scored, the game is pretty much over.  I originally had two GLCs instead of two Rototurrets; however, the two subroutines really helped slow down the runner as well as kill some pesky data suckers.  I got 6th in the Taipei Tournament with the first variant of this deck; however, I switched to the second identity and took out the tracing ICE to speed the deck up. In my Shaper heavy meta, this deck usually scores too quickly for them to stop me.  The two decks that give me trouble are CTFaerush and Reina.  Both of these match ups though prove less troublesome once I get DataRaven in front of HQ. The tags feed the Closed Accounts and provides a small enough window to score with SfSS.<\/p>\n","username":"evilpanda","cards":{"01064":2,"01081":3,"01082":3,"01083":3,"01084":1,"01085":1,"01088":2,"01090":2,"01092":3,"01101":2,"01107":1,"01111":2,"01113":3,"02056":2,"02114":1,"02115":3,"03023":1,"04012":2,"04015":2,"04034":3,"04076":3}},{"id":2184,"name":"back to basics","creation":"2014-02-12 14:19:32","description":"\n","username":"evilpanda","cards":{"01007":2,"01011":1,"01017":1,"01018":3,"01021":2,"01022":3,"01024":3,"01026":1,"01028":3,"01050":3,"01053":3,"02007":2,"02009":2,"02043":2,"02085":1,"02091":2,"02104":3,"02106":2,"03052":3,"03054":3,"04063":2}},{"id":2185,"name":"\"State-of-the-Art.

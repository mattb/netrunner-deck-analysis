I've tried lots of variations over the last month or so and eventually I landed on this configuration, it's a bit different than other builds but it gives you a lot of options.  It used to run aesop's and wyldside and that is a good variant as well, especially now with cache.  This deck always gives you a fighting chance, and tends to make for very interesting games, but sometimes it feels a step behind power wise, so thought I would share and hopefully get some fresh eyes and ideas on where to take it.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Playstyle<\/h3>\n\n<p>Consistent steady aggression, try to keep remotes from getting too strong, early random accesses are good, but not at the cost of having a turn where you are broke and powerless; with noises ability you get random accesses all game long, so better is to keep the corp pinned down, and steadily build up your board until there are too many threats at once for the corp to handle.  I think of it, as an increasing pressure deck.  Basically, this means keep running steadily, but never go all out, leave money and cards in reserve to wait for when the corp makes a big move, don't force them, play reactively and let them think there is an opening, then pounce on it.  Once recurring credits are going, you can actually accomplish a lot with very few credits, which can surprise a corp player.  <\/p>\n\n<h3>Breakers<\/h3>\n\n<p>Darwin and Parasite, plus a few others for particular scenarios that can be problematic.  I've listed knight and sharpshooter below as the build has been 2 knight and 1 sharpshooter, but I just started testing the 3 D4v1d instead, not sure what is more useful.<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Corroder deals with wraparound.<\/li>\n<li>Sharpshooter is for a surprise archer or Grim.<\/li>\n<li>Knight is for anything else; tollbooth, or running safely at possible archers mostly.<\/li>\n<li>D4v1d seems like it could replace knight and sharpshooter so I am trying it out.<\/li>\n<li>Atman was in here for a long time, but it was almost never being used.  It may be the ice people are running right now, so maybe it should come back in at some point.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<h3>Economy<\/h3>\n\n<p>Economy aims to get the most bang for the fewest clicks and then Kati jones to keep things going.  Except for Kati, all 4 Econ cards only use one or two clicks but give big payouts, 4, 6, 6, and 5; for sure gamble, lucky find, queens gambit, and daily casts respectively.  These then also help burst you up to have enough money to drop out your cyber feeders and spinal modem, at least one of which is essential to make Darwin playable.  Gotta keep shovelling in that krill!  <\/p>\n\n<p>Queen's gambit is maybe the only unusual one, but it has been great for me, in twenty plus games, I've only guessed atrociously wrong once, (atlas!), most decks right now have upgrades or assets so it almost always finds a target.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Programs<\/h3>\n\n<p>Pretty standard virus suite, I've found that datasucker, parasite, and imp are the most important viruses.  Not getting them when you want them is bad, so I use two djinns and a self modifying code to improve consistency and djinn's memory boost is almost always helpful, but never essential.  One of each nerve agent and medium seems the right amount and you can usually get one to help turn the screws, if you get an opening on one of the centrals.<\/p>\n\n<p>A note on parasites, there are never enough of them, so you need to be very selective with your parasites, don't just parasite things right away because you can, your priority is to kill off difficult to repeatedly break ice on the <strong>servers you want to run on<\/strong>.  Usually, I prioritize any scoring remote first, then on whichever central you want to strike with medium or nerve agent.  It's so easy to just throw a parasite on the first pop up, roto turret or Eli you see, but it isn't always the right play since you may not get another one for when you really need it later.  Only do it, if you are going to run there immediately afterward, or it strengthens your threat on that server significantly, e.g. Parasite on r&amp;d if you have a medium in hand.  However, usually if it's a juicy target like komainu or Tsurugi, you just go for it anyway since those ice are prohibitively expensive to break using Darwin.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Tricks and Meta Calls<\/h3>\n\n<p><strong>Surge!!<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>I greatly undervalued this card before, it has been very strong for me, it almost always leads to me scoring points.  You only ever play it, if the opponent has done something where they are counting on a parasited ice to stay alive 1 more turn, or a Darwin not having enough strength, or a medium dig only being 1 or 2 cards.

I was getting beat down by jinteki pe, and I didn't like going the keyhole route, Infiltrate doesn't help because I don't have same old thing, and the damage prevention cards still seem weaker to me, so code cracker.  No plascrete, because I can keep up in Econ with Kati jones and if you think they are playing scorch, you start Imping hq aggressively.

The agenda setup is pretty much how I want it, although I am giving consideration to dropping to 2 Vitruvius and going up to 2 NAPD. More testing required there.<\/p>\n\n<p>Mother Goddess is out. I doubt it will come back. I got caught up in the idea that it could be a STR4 extra bit of NEXT ICE, but in reality when you lay down as much ice as this deck, if they get any icebreaker they can get through it. At the same time, I have no interest in going back to Fenris. As ever, I'm in the market for decent sentries.<\/p>\n\n<p>I've taken a few beatings with this deck recently, and although I won some of them it was far tighter than I would have liked. In all cases it pretty much came down to the same thing; once the runner has a full rig I don't have much of a way to slow them. Agg Secs very rarely fire, and Ash can only be used once or twice. When Will o the Wisp comes out, I'll switch them in for the Secs.<\/p>\n\n<p>In the meantime, I need a better way to slow the runner. Ichi seems like the best option, and I do need to boost my sentry suite. I've also considered Chimera, although I hate the repeating cost. It does force the runner to get every breaker, though.<\/p>\n\n<p>Some other considerations which I will test in due course: There are now 4 bits of ice capable of destroying programs, so I will consider giving the corporate troubleshooter a whirl. My concern is that this deck is never overflowing with money, so I might simply get outbid.<\/p>\n\n<p>Alternatively, this deck is pretty fast at heart, and is meant to capitalise on early ICE advantage. With this in mind it could be worth investing in a Fast Track or two so that I don't get stuck waiting for agendas whilst they get their rig together.<\/p>\n\n<p>Effectively it's two ways of approaching my late-game problem: Do I let the late game happen and adjust accordingly, or do I try and maximize my early advantage and be that much closer to winning when the late game rolls around?<\/p>\n\n<p>Interesting how being on the ropes has really got me thinking, but I guess it's a case of 'calm seas never made a sailor' and all that! Anyway, I'm going to try the Ichi-Troubleshooter route first. A little worried about the increased cost of the ICE suite, but all my sentries have been expensive the whole time, so I guess I'll just have to hope these are expensive but useful.<\/p>\n","username":"Jashay","cards":{"01055":3,"01057":2,"01062":2,"01064":2,"01065":1,"01090":1,"01098":3,"01103":2,"01110":3,"02011":2,"02012":1,"02013":2,"02019":2,"02051":3,"02052":1,"02059":2,"02110":2,"03003":1,"03015":1,"03023":2,"04011":3,"04030":1,"04096":1,"04119":1,"04120":3,"06002":3}},{"id":8727,"name":"Foundry Street","creation":"2014-08-19 13:00:03","description":"<p>We busted out The Foundry last night after figuring out that Stronger Together wasn't cutting it and that the best cards in the deck were the Ash and Caprice. <\/p>\n\n<p>Here's where we were after a night of playing with this deck, more or less. <\/p>\n\n<p>I wish there was more room for Jackson Howards, and more Domestic Sleepers, and Viktor 1.0, and Will o' the Wisp...<\/p>\n\n<p>This deck draws loads of cards; it's fantastic.

Whizzard was chosen because Donut can tax operation-based economies, and Whizzard can trash the asset-based economies<\/p>\n\n<p>It was originally three Donuts and no Hostages, but this way seems slightly more consistent. I can use the Hostages to search out Kati, too. I unashamedly stole this idea from the DONUTS deck in the hall of fame.<\/p>\n\n<p>The original version (unpublished, I'm afraid) used Vamp and Lamprey to keep the Corp low on money, and because of the caveat on Lamprey I avoided using the virus multi-access cards, instead going for the Interfaces.<\/p>\n\n<p>However, Lamprey has moved on to pastures new, so I've used the influence for Clone Chips and put the viruses back in. The number of times being able to whip out a bishop or knight at instant speed would have won me the game is crazy. There were originally three pawns, but 5x chess recursion seems plenty now.<\/p>\n\n<p>It can take while to get rolling, but a lot of the time you can slow the corp enough in the early game and come out on top in the end. I am always amazed at how much ICE people will trash to get rid of the Caissas: In my last game vs Jinteki, 9 out of 18 pieces in the deck were sacrificed to kill the chesspieces. This, combined with their abilities and the fixed breakers, can make your runs very cheap.<\/p>\n\n<p>The deck's two main weaknesses are lack of tutoring and card draw, which can slow you down in your quest for breakers, and a total lack of scorch protection. So far I've rarely faced the scorch decks, and when I have I've managed to keep 5 cards in hand and their money low through Donut, Vamp, Rook and Xanadu. \nSomething that has not yet come up is really big ice: if you can get Bishop and\/or Ice carver, you can deal with 95% of the stuff, but it's when you hit Archer without a Knight\/Crypsis as backup that things go wrong, I imagine.<\/p>\n\n<p>How to play it:<\/p>\n\n<p>Don't worry about running first turn too much; you'll be better off in the long run if you can get an economy card down. Donut is an awesome early play in most cases, but if you're sure your opponent isn't running tonnes of operations you can Hostage out Kati instead.<\/p>\n\n<p>If they play an asset, go smash it. Feel free to run centrals if you need. Make liberal use of the Caissas, but don't throw them away. If you can, move them onto rezzed ICE when not in use; if the corp starts trashing what they've already paid for, that's even better for you. <\/p>\n\n<p>Vamp's usefulness varies, so try and get a decent feel for the when, and always get rid of tags. You've got all the resources, you don't want them trashed!<\/p>\n\n<p>Once you've ruined their ICE suite and economy, simply start hammering wherever you like with your efficient breakers. There's only a little multi-access here, as by the time you really need one you've often drawn it.<\/p>\n\n<p>Anyway, thus far I've been having a lot of fun with this deck, but I'd welcome suggestions for improvements.<\/p>\n","username":"Jashay","cards":{"01007":2,"01010":1,"01011":3,"01014":2,"01015":2,"01051":1,"01053":3,"02001":1,"02021":2,"02022":3,"02041":1,"02082":1,"02091":2,"03038":3,"03053":2,"04002":2,"04003":2,"04004":2,"04021":3,"04042":3,"04043":3,"05055":2}},{"id":8729,"name":"GRNDL SuperModernism","creation":"2014-08-19 13:13:36","description":"\n","username":"Alsciende","cards":{"01070":3,"01083":2,"01086":1,"01094":3,"01099":3,"01101":3,"01103":3,"01110":3,"01111":3,"01113":3,"02018":3,"02060":2,"02077":1,"02080":2,"04017":3,"04020":3,"04040":3,"04058":2,"04097":1,"04100":3}},{"id":8730,"name":"Hissatsu","creation":"2014-08-19 13:41:05","description":"<p>chou damage, very deathblow, wow<\/p>\n","username":"Intrasolar","cards":{"01067":1,"01070":3,"01072":1,"01075":2,"01076":3,"01084":2,"01098":3,"01099":1,"01110":3,"02032":3,"02060":2,"03023":3,"04033":2,"04058":3,"04093":2,"04120":2,"05004":3,"05005":3,"05006":1,"05011":3,"05017":1,"05018":1,"06003":1,"06012":1}},{"id":8731,"name":"Stronger Psychics","creation":"2014-08-19 14:04:19","description":"\n","username":"CodeMarvelous","cards":{"01057":2,"01062":2,"01063":3,"01064":2,"01091":2,"01106":2,"01108":2,"01110":3,"02010":1,"02092":3,"02110":3,"03006":2,"03015":2,"03019":2,"03023":2,"04011":3,"04015":3,"04114":2,"04119":3,"06002":3,"06023":3}},{"id":8732,"name":"Top 16 Canadian Nationals","creation":"2014-08-19 14:37:13","description":"<p>No nonsense criminal build, this exact list is tweaked a little bit to help against glacier RP, HB decks, and also asset based NEH but otherwise is pretty standard. <\/p>\n\n<p>I did well in the Swiss rounds but did not bring my A game in eliminations and went down quickly to some worthy opponents.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Went 4-2 in Swiss, losing to two NEH decks.

With <a href=\"\/en\/card\/06021\">The Foundry: Refining the Process<\/a>, it allows him to quickly abuse the newest ice types (both Next and Grail!), lower density of \"dead cards\" (by giving the equivalent to a targeted draw every time you rez and ice), increases the hand-size (lowering the probability of a snipe from HQ), and protects the player from not being able to get the ice he wants when he wants it.  But with <a href=\"\/en\/card\/06001\">Domestic Sleepers<\/a>, HB finally gets a way to splash <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01101\">Archer<\/a>, something that is made even better due to the Foundary's ability to tutor for the second!  Because of the tutoring ability, I've spread the ice into groups of 2x and 3x, depending on what I need to see first and what I'd like to see in twos.  The obvious 3x are <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02110\">Eli 1.0<\/a>, <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04011\">NEXT Bronze<\/a>, and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/06002\">NEXT Silver<\/a>.  Due to a personal preference, i've decided to focus on a glacier build (deep taxing ice) + program destruction to slow the runner down.  <\/p>\n\n<p>First, the glacier build should be obvious.  No real surprises here: Eli, NEXT, and Tollbooth provide the backbone to the taxing ice.  The rest of the ice is really built for security + program destruction.  That's Archer, <a href=\"\/en\/card\/03015\">Heimdall 2.0<\/a>, and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04030\">Wotan<\/a>.  It also provides a reason for <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01057\">Aggressive Secretary<\/a>. The Inazuma's are there to really punish the runner if it's before an Archer, Heimdall, or Wotan--man that would hurt... <\/p>\n\n<p>The assets feed into this strategy. and help disguise the large agendas that I'm playing (overwhelmingly 3-pointers, with the 1-pointers thrown in for getting to 7 if I've scored 3x already, or else for feeding to a hungry archer). Obviously, Wotan and Heimdall would love a priority rec, but both--my major ETR ice--also love getting an additional \"ETR\" subroutine from <a href=\"\/en\/card\/03006\">Project Wotan<\/a>. Mandatory Upgrades is a single, just because i've always wanted an extra click per turn (making it easier to score the larger agendas), land harder traps, or make more money.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Returning to the assets (that I claimed to talk about last paragraph!): they're to help obscure the agendas.  Eve is chosen over Adonis because it's more expensive to trash, Jackson is obvious, but Cerebral, Aggressive, Haas Arcology, and Thomas Haas can all be advanced as though they were agendas and then used to powerful result (no one like's a 2x advanced Aggressive Secretary or Cerebral Overwriter!).  Haas is something where I can drop it it, then advanced it 3x the next turn (either disguising it as a Mandatory Upgrades, or else gaining enough clicks to advance a 3-pointer from hand.  Thomas Haas is good to drop tokens on when you're not sure what else to do, and can give you a great burst economy before an ice rez, after after a lucky Account Siphon, and is even better if the runner spends a bunch of money and clicks running that server only to find it's gone away before they could do anything!  <\/p>\n\n<p>Otherwise, Ashes and Hedge Funds are pretty much gimmes here.  There are other ways to spend the influence, obviously, and lots of fun things that would love to be in this deck, but this is one fun way to run. <\/p>\n\n<p>This is in beta testing and not complete. The arcology and an ash may give way for Adonises.

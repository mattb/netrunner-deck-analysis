At first it was a slow advance deck, but that didn't fit my style. I tend to be very aggressive in games, so I generally got really bored half way slow advance games.<\/p>\n\n<p>This deck is loosely based of x3r0h0ur's MedTech FA (http:\/\/netrunnerdb.com\/en\/decklist\/6407\/medtech-fa). I primarily tweaked the ICE and operations. I threw it together the evening before the tournament.<\/p>\n\n<p>It was only a small tournament and after 3 rounds of swiss it won 6-2, 4-3 (Flatline) and 6-2.<\/p>\n\n<p>Just to get a general idea of all the choices made:<\/p>\n\n<h2>Agenda's:<\/h2>\n\n<p>Pretty standard for a Jinteki FA deck. All 3\/2's and Philotic is even more fun if your opponent scored a few Shi.Kyu's.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Assets:<\/h2>\n\n<p>This deck is low on ICE, which means you don't have much to defend many assets either. Mental Health is awesome. Free to rez and 3 to trash. Don't care if my opponent has a bigger hand size. Shock is there to keep my opponent on his toes. Often when they see a shock they also begin to sweat for a Snare. <\/p>\n\n<p>I would love to say Shi.Kyu is awesome, but it's just a good card. I never put in more than 3-4 creds for net damage. It's tempting to try and flatline him and put in 6 (which I did the first time I played this card), but that is not the point of this card. It's the -1 agenda point and you just have to tempt him on the edge. 3-4 net damage is still not fun and will make many players doubt. These cards are also in the deck for against millers. I don't have jackson in this deck, so this is the next best thing.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Upgrades:<\/h2>\n\n<p>Nothing special. It wouldn't be FA if there was no SanSan. Might want to try and fit in Caprice, but I still prefer ash. Much more reliable.<\/p>\n\n<p>Operations: More econ! Hedge fund and Sweeps are the primary divers. Only play Celebrity\/MRF when you are short on cash and need a big boost. There is absolutely nothing wrong with clicking for credits. I never show my hand if it contains SanSan or an agenda (except NAPD), it gives away my game plan.<\/p>\n\n<h2>ICE:<\/h2>\n\n<p>Wall of Static: Boring, but it does the job. I don't like paper wall. If you run low on ICE, than you shouldn't put in ICE that destroys itself.<\/p>\n\n<p>Wraparound: Anti Atman. I love this card. It stops AI breakers (except Knights) dead in their tracks and also ends the run. Swordsman is also a good option, but I needed more end the run ICE.<\/p>\n\n<p>Quandy: Same as Wall of Static<\/p>\n\n<p>Guard: Hardly used it. Guard is on of those cards that is expensive for what it primarily does (end the run), but is great insurance if you go against criminals. You know you can get better, but you can't live without it. I always withhold this card until I know my opponent has bypass programs\/events. 4 rez for a S2 end the run is a lot of money.<\/p>\n\n<p>Komainu: If you can get a Knight to sit on this card then you are golden. I put this card over my archives against a milling deck. Knight was his only real breaker. \"I'm gonna run archives\" 'Sure, pay 10 creds', needless to say he only only had 4 and I had 3 shock and 2 Shi.Kyu lying there (ditched them once I knew he was ignoring my HQ).<\/p>\n\n<p>Pup:  1 rez, 2 to pass. Great Ice over R&amp;D. Love Pup<\/p>\n\n<p>Susanoo: Played her once. S7 on a sentry is pretty damn steep. Logical combo with Shock and Shi.Kyu.<\/p>\n\n<p>Tsurugi: Still on the fence with this one. I primarily put it in here as taxing ICE that is less vulnerable to parasites.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion:<\/h2>\n\n<p>To say this deck is a beast, might be a little bit of a hyperbole. It is really easy to go a fast as possible, but it is actually the other way around. Take your time. Take a lot of time! ICE is few and you have to prepare everything correctly. Get your money, draw your SanSan, let him steal one or two agenda's. A stolen Medical Breakthrough is just as good for you as it is for him. Once you start: Don't stop. When I played I tried to make sure I had enough money in play or in my hand to rez SanSan and two agenda's (not always easy) within a timespan of 3 turns (Turn 1: Score, Turn 2: econ and draw, Turn 3: score). It is only a matter of time before he gets in and trashes SanSan.<\/p>\n\n<p>IMO Harmony MedTech is about sharing and giving things to the runner, but in the mean time you get a bigger advantage out of it.<\/p>\n","username":"Weezel","cards":{"01092":2,"01110":3,"01113":2,"02014":3,"04012":3,"04073":3,"04074":1,"04076":2,"04096":2,"04119":2,"04120":2,"05001":1,"05005":3,"05006":1,"05009":3,"05011":3,"05014":2,"05017":2,"05018":2,"05020":1,"05024":2}},{"id":6582,"name":"Pressure Painting","creation":"2014-06-10 11:12:26","description":"\n","username":"frolic","cards":{"01012":2,"01036":3,"01043":1,"01050":3,"02009":2,"02087":3,"02106":2,"03028":1,"03031":2,"03035":1,"03038":3,"03046":3,"03048":1,"03049":3,"03052":3,"04006":3,"04029":3,"04067":3,"04108":1,"04109":3}},{"id":6583,"name":"That's Kate's Theory (5th Place Louisville Regionals)","creation":"2014-06-10 11:18:42","description":"<p>This is the runner deck I took to the Louisville event that took place this reason.  It focuses on a combination of speed and bigrig to keep pressure on throughout the whole game.  Mopus gives you all the Econ you will need and the combination of tutors and draws lets you power out the other pieces to your rig.  I usually spend my first tutor on Mopus if it isn't in my opening draw, as it is really the foundation the deck is built on.  Femme and the targeted breakers like Sharpshooter are there to help you maximize the efficiency of your runs creditwise.<\/p>\n\n<p>Legwork and Account Siphon provide a strong way to make single HQ runs count and to pressure both HQ and R&amp;D.  It sort of surprised me, but Siphon kept catching people off-guard during the day allowing me to capture some unexpected ground in otherwise even games.  Legwork is even shinier then I expected.  More than one of my games were won off the back of this card.<\/p>\n\n<p>One of the unusual choices this deck was the inclusion of Pipeline, as well as the choice to stick to 46 cards.  Having only Femme as a sentry breaker was continually a drawback during testing, and adding pipeline gave me a much cheaper way to deal with things like Guard and Komainu\/Tsurugi.  It also acted as a downpayment on my Femme later if I drew into Scavenge and Femme before Test Run.  I ended up at 46 cards to keep 3 copies of Dinosaurus in.  Getting a sentry breaker onto it just helps significantly.<\/p>\n\n<p>I think the most amusing game of the event for this deck was against a Redcoats HB player, where I ended up with nearly 100 credits in a money war to end all money wars.  The corp player ended up one turn from milling out with an AP score of 6-4 my favor before I ran the remote to force a Caprice rez to trash the currently rezzed Caprice on HQ so I could legwork the hand for the game winning points.<\/p>\n\n<p>Across the course of the day the deck went 4-2 in Swiss and 1-2 in elimination.  Losses during swiss were to Jinteki RP and HB:ETF FA.  Losses during elimination were to NBN rush\/scorch.  The losses against NBN felt very much like a coin flip as I couldn't rigup faster than they could Astrotrain thanks to the new Fast Track, the game where I beat NBN I was able to prevent the first Astro score.  NBN games were the few games where having Gordian instead of ZU Keymaster hurt me for sure, as the extra 3 credits didn't really buy me anything.  The deck was able to beat HB:ETF FA (a list nearly identical to my corp list for this event as my friend and I played very similar decks) and Redcoats, NBN Rush, Tennin Never Advance, Weyland Powershutdown + AD over the course of the day.<\/p>\n","username":"Flashfires","cards":{"01007":1,"01018":2,"01026":1,"01033":1,"01034":3,"01038":3,"01043":1,"01044":2,"01046":1,"01050":3,"02009":2,"02047":2,"02048":3,"02066":1,"02087":2,"02106":2,"02107":2,"03034":2,"03035":1,"03038":3,"03046":3,"03054":3,"04067":1,"05035":2}},{"id":6584,"name":"Who's NEXT?","creation":"2014-06-10 11:41:25","description":"<p>Basic HB glacier deck: get money, build a strong server, score.

This deck focuses on maximizing credit differential with the runner, both by playing expensive and taxing ICE and by utilizing HB:ETFs power to it's advantage.<\/p>\n\n<p>The key choice that makes this deck slightly different is to use Trick of Light as the other fast advance mechanism to complement Biotic Labor.  Trick of Light really shines here (pun intended) as the turn you score an agenda you spend a net of only 1 credit (Gain 1 installing, spend 1 advancing, spend 1 to ToL).  This really mitigates any tempo loss that scoring an agenda would normally give you (compare to the 6 credits you have to spend to Biotic something out or the 7 to use a SanSan City Grid).  <\/p>\n\n<p>Gila Hands Arcology is one of the keys of pressing this economic edge.  once you have one scored you never bottom out of credits and being able to take 3 for 2 clicks is just incredibly good in this deck.  Scoring a Gila as the first agenda raises your win rate significantly.  I am definitely going to test cutting something to add a third one of these in given how good they are for the deck.  The opponent also doesn't really gain much for stealing a second one, so as long as I can get one I'm okay with seeing the rest go.<\/p>\n\n<p>Remotes in this deck are only used as extraneous features for Eve Campaigns  (another great card for swinging credit advantage) or Jackson Howard.  They also make a great home for Ice Walls at a 1c profit with the ETF ability.  This enables you to only defend your two critical centrals, with some backup for archives as needed against Gabe or Noise (or the increasingly popular Sec Testing Andy Datasucker deck).<\/p>\n\n<p>I decided to drop my third Jackson Howard for Closed Accounts to protect the otherwise toothless purple deck from TagMe runners.  I also decided to use my other one off slot for Archived Memories.  I tested using Reclamation Order instead, and while it was more powerful I value the flexibility of my clicks more than the ability to recur often unneeded extra Biotics.  <\/p>\n\n<p>This deck went 4-2 in Swiss and 2-0 in elimination.  In swiss my losses were to Kate bigrig, due to very unlucky accesses in my estimation (my opponent went from 4-7 in one 2 card R&amp;D access while I was on 6 AP) and to a Noise SMC + Clone Chip deck due to my own mishandling of his Stimhack during his last chance to win in a glory run on R&amp;D.  My wins in swiss were against a Kate deck similar to my other list from this tourney (my friend and I played nearly identical decks), CT rush, Gabe Knight, and a Noise deck.  In elimination I defeated a very unorthodox CT deck running Crescentus, Sneakdoor, Nerve Agent and Djinn and another Noise player playing the more traditional DLR mill deck which I was able to control and keep broke once he was tagged thanks to Closed Accounts and the economic edge to just turn on ICE left and right.  I really broke him when he took his last 4 Armitage dollars off his codebusting and then Sure Gambled to end on 13 creds and I immediately closed his accounts.

With Kate the discount you get really smooths out the economy at the start allowing you to pressure the corp earlier. This is key because you want to get your parasites out soon as possible. Replicator is really the star of this deck, you have two sources of economy with recurring credits from spinal modem and cyberfeeder and Magnum Opus for supplemental economy. The replicator helps get out those key pieces of hardware way quicker. A good starting hand will have MO or a way to get it out and replicator.

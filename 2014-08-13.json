Real rich. Get your Dysons and UwCs out, using Logos if needed. Make money, take money. The goal is to brute-force any server, any ice into submission.<\/p>\n\n<p>Iain &amp; The Underworld Contacts: You will want to get them out as soon as you can play them, before or after the Dysons. Logos the missing piece if given the chance. This is the motor at the heart of the deck.<\/p>\n\n<p>Siphon: If you can beat down the Corp, do it. You're best off keeping them in hand until you can use it to get a $2 lead over the Corp. Doing so means they won't try to catch you with a SEA Source or a Midseasons, if you can maintain that lead. Link is on your side here. For obvious reasons, don't Siphon unless you can shed all tags. <\/p>\n\n<p>Icebreakers: These is the most efficient breaker suite available for the influence. Save your Femme for Data Ravens and Tollbooths on HQ or R&amp;D. You're still likely to end up installing Garrote anyway, for Ichis and the like. The central-only breakers are icing, but can help you save a cred or 2 per run.<\/p>\n\n<p>Gorman &amp; Keyhole: Gorman is a placeholder. Got an empty MU, install it. Need to install something else, trash it or eat it. Save Keyhole for late-game. You want them to blow cash trying to get deep walls up around remotes and HQ. Try to flush out Jackson before Keyholing in earnest.<\/p>\n\n<p>Everything else: Get money. Kate, Tri-Maf, ProfCon, Dealer are there to get you through slow turns while you install your rig, and to quickly replenish your accounts when you run a deep server. Express Delivery when you have all but one piece in place.<\/p>\n\n<p>Weaknesses: Bait servers and their IDs (RP, Near Earth) will have low ice, but probably a lot of traps. A lone Mother Goddess can stop you on one server for a turn or 2. Damage too early can mean losing all breakers of a type, so install before running. Janus is still a pain in the ass.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Alternatives: Hostages in place of Calling in Favors. Sneakdoor or Hemorrhage or Datasuckers for Keyhole. HQI or Legwork for multiple accesses. Crypsis in place of a Gorman.<\/p>\n","username":"verge","cards":{"01007":1,"01018":3,"01019":3,"01022":2,"01026":1,"01031":1,"01043":1,"01050":3,"02009":1,"02028":2,"02069":3,"02091":2,"03049":1,"03052":3,"03053":3,"04005":3,"04061":1,"04063":1,"04065":1,"05028":1,"05031":3,"05033":1,"05037":2,"05042":1,"05046":1,"05050":2}},{"id":8512,"name":"Some (big) Chaos (some advice ?)","creation":"2014-08-13 05:57:48","description":"<p>It's more a test deck than a really competitive deck.

The idea is to place down snowflakes as cheap, reasonably reliable, parasite resistant ETR ice, tutoring for them with Levy University as needed, and then mutate them into the big guys, notably Janus. <\/p>\n\n<p>Agendas are chosen so that they all cost money to steal, setting back the Runner's tempo and giving you time to set up. Also, the most likely way for them to win is to take a Future Perfect and two 2 pointers, so a single Shi.Kyu will force them to have to steal an extra agenda.<\/p>\n\n<p>Assets are fairly straightforward; Sundews and Pad Campaigns for steady income; Snares to pad HQ and threaten flatline after they've taken some brain damage, etc.<\/p>\n\n<p>Operations are primarily econ for rezzing big ice without Mutate, and of course Mutate to get janky ice on the table.<\/p>\n\n<p>Ideally the three centrals will have Janus or Susan as the outermost pieces so that they have to pass through a Janus before hitting any remotes. And if they click through Janus, they have to take two brain damage in order to have any clicks left to run remotes!<\/p>\n\n<p>I'm not sure at all how reliable this is, how long it takes to set up, or how vulnerable the deck is before it's set up.

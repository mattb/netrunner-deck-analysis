[{"id":631,"name":"Parasital Nightmare","creation":"2013-11-22 05:50:11","description":"This is the (I think) fifth Iteration of a deck built around the idea of recurring parasites. <br>It has been built using only the Cards available in one copy of the Core Set, that's why you will only find two Datasuckers and Djinns, instead of three.<br>As only ICE-breaker there are two copies of Wyrm (probably would be three as well, if I had a second Core Set). I think Wyrm performs quite nicely in this deck, as you do not want to use him to break subroutines but rather decrease the ICE strength to zero (in combination with ICE Carver and Datasucker tokens) so that your Parasites kill the ICE. <br>I found this to be quite efficient. By hosting the Parasites on Personal Workshop or by getting them out of the heap with my Clone Chips, I can use them either mid-run on nasty ICE or I can just not do so, if the ICE can be broken rather cheaply by Wyrm or if the effects of the ICE are not so drastic. <br><br>This deck has no direct means of credit denial mechanisms involved. The only thing (as always with Noise) is that you might trash important economy-cards from R&D. <br><br>What I hope for, when I run with this deck, is that I get one of my Wyldsides out early and hope for getting Djinn and Wyrm fast on my grip, as I have no ways of tutoring them. Of course, early Personal Workshop + Grimoire + Cyberfeeders are amazing. <br><br>Another nice start would be something like: Datasucker + Datasucker + Gorman Drip v1.0 + Dirty Laundry on archives. Apart from getting your Datasuckers loaded you might already steal the first Agenda :)<br><br>What I particularly like about this deck, is that it is quite flexible. Due to the fact that you usually destroy the ICE your opponent rezzes, you do not need that much economy. However, there is quite a lot of it in the deck, just so that you are able to also use your Wyrm if you want to save the parasites for later. <br>The corp really needs to secure all three of his central as you do have Mediums and Nerve Agents in order to dig deeply into the centrals. Without Jackson Howard, the archives will be your destination to run after a couple of rounds. With Imp you can trash the ICE before it is installed, bringing the Corp into even more trouble, as he loses means to secure his servers. <br><br>I'd be more than happy to receive some feedback on this deck. I am pretty sure, that the exchange of 3 Surges with 1 Wyrm, 1 Djinn & 1 Datasucker might further improve the strength and flexibility.

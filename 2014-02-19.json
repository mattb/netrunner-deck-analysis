Based only on theorycrafting up to now, I see huge potential in forcing the corp to go at least 3 Ice deep on centrals AND remotes to keep me out. Keyhole was added because it puts pressure on R&amp;D as well as archives and force the corp to ice both up. As a nice side effect I can ruin the corps game plan by trashing key cards like SanSan, scorched or just the good old Hedge Fund.<\/p>\n\n<p>Once the Corp does go 3 deep, I have my ways to deal with it either through a Femme counter, a Knight or Atman. In case I end up with 4 deep (which can happen), a combination of those should still get me in. I can also Test Run a Femme for a surprise \"inside job\" on a remote. Knight fulfills a double purpose in this Deck, I need him to apply early pressure and also crack the middle Ice once Alpha and Omega are on the field. Of course, all of this will eat a whole lot of MU (especially with Magnum), so this is where the Cyber Solutions Chip comes in. Akamatsu is not going to cut it, especially with Keyhole and Magnum both eating up 2 MU each. I included Stimhack mainly because I had a slot and one Influence left over, but it also synergizes nicely with the deck in allowing me to make a surprise run when the corp thought I was out of credits.<\/p>\n","username":"Maximus","cards":{"01004":1,"01026":2,"01033":1,"01034":3,"01035":3,"01044":3,"01050":3,"01053":3,"02047":3,"02085":1,"02087":2,"03035":2,"03040":2,"03046":3,"03053":3,"04043":2,"04061":2,"04086":3,"04087":2,"04088":2}},{"id":2367,"name":"Jinteki Fast ad","creation":"2014-02-19 07:27:10","description":"\n","username":"bot2563","cards":{"01058":1,"01070":3,"01075":2,"01092":2,"01103":3,"01110":3,"01111":2,"02014":3,"02033":3,"02110":1,"04012":3,"04013":2,"04015":3,"04032":3,"04053":3,"04073":3,"05003":1,"05005":3,"05006":1,"05017":3,"05024":2}},{"id":2368,"name":"Fast Scorched Earth","creation":"2014-02-19 09:08:45","description":"\n","username":"Link","cards":{"01084":2,"01093":1,"01094":2,"01098":3,"01099":3,"01101":2,"01102":2,"01103":2,"01106":2,"01110":3,"01111":2,"02018":3,"02037":2,"02070":3,"02116":2,"03026":2,"03027":3,"04015":2,"04036":2,"04040":3}},{"id":2369,"name":"Rapid Professor Deck ","creation":"2014-02-19 09:18:29","description":"\n","username":"ezgee","cards":{"01007":1,"01011":1,"01012":1,"01014":1,"01027":1,"01028":1,"01034":3,"01035":3,"01036":3,"01037":3,"01041":2,"01043":3,"01046":3,"01049":3,"01050":3,"01051":2,"01053":3,"02003":1,"02004":1,"02045":1,"03029":1,"03046":3,"03052":3,"03053":3}},{"id":2370,"name":"Return of the Noise","creation":"2014-02-19 10:21:38","description":"<p>1st place @ Crossroad Games Standish, ME - Store Championship<\/p>\n","username":"Netrunomicon","cards":{"01001":1,"01002":2,"01004":1,"01006":3,"01007":2,"01008":3,"01009":3,"01011":2,"01012":3,"01016":3,"01019":3,"01047":1,"01050":3,"01051":2,"02003":3,"02009":2,"02091":3,"03038":2,"03047":3,"04061":2}},{"id":2371,"name":"Boring Old HB FA","creation":"2014-02-19 10:34:25","description":"<p>1st place @ Crossroad Games Standish, ME - Store Championship<\/p>\n","username":"Netrunomicon","cards":{"01054":1,"01055":3,"01056":3,"01059":3,"01061":2,"01062":2,"01064":3,"01092":3,"01103":3,"01108":2,"01110":3,"01111":2,"01113":2,"02030":2,"02051":3,"02052":1,"02070":2,"02110":1,"03005":3,"03019":1,"03023":2,"04015":3}},{"id":2372,"name":"Noobie's First Try","creation":"2014-02-19 10:54:47","description":"<p>I've only been playing Netrunner for just under a month.

It is the perfect setup for solid early ETRs and then destroyers to buy a bit of time once they get breakers. If you have more then one available, the power shutdowns can also try to snipe cheap breakers. And don't worry about the bad pub. You'll win\/lose before it matters. <\/p>\n\n<p>The plan: Score Efficiency Committee the hard way. Draw into Shipment from SS and use it to score another Efficiency Committee or a Vitruvirus with one counter from hand. Draw\/vitruvirus into JH, Priority Req, Power Shutdown and Accelerated while ditching other 2 Shipments if drawn. Once ready, spend last Efficiency counter to install Priority, install JH and then do the Power Shutdown combo with 3 shipments, winning.<\/p>\n\n<p>I'm still working on perfecting it, but the premise seems solid in light testing. Might consider dropping something for an extra Accelerated Diagnostics (enhance reliability), adding anonymous tips for even more draw power and trying the other HB identities (Next or ETF could be interesting for rush\/money respectively).

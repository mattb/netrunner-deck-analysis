I bought the core set + the genesis add-ons a few weeks ago...<\/p>\n\n<p>My aim here, is not having a performing deck for tournaments but a deck with a good card synergy for casual players like me. When I build my first deck (HB-Engineering: Make it Slow) I saw that it was too passive. So I try to build another HB deck more aggresive based on the HB archetype: the brain damages.<\/p>\n\n<p>So, what I want here is deal as much brain damage as possible to the runner. But my only way to do that is by my ICEs. And a runner would not approach an ICE that he knows he can't break. We have to hide him as much information on our ICEs as possible. The key cards are:\n- 1 Security Subcontract, to trash the rezzed ICEs and gain credits to rez other.\n- 2 Archived Memories, to retrieve the trashed ICEs.\n- 3 Project Vitruvius, for the same reason\n- 1 Akitaro Watanabe, to lower the rez cost of our ICEs.<\/p>\n\n<p>What about the ICEs? I've taken all the brain damage ones:\n- 2 Heimdall 1.0\n- 2 Viktor 1.0\n- 2 Ichi 1.0\n- 2 Janus 1.0\nI've completed with:\n- 2 Eli 1.0, good HB barrier\n- 2 Enigma, fits wel with BIOROID\n- 2 Hourglass, the same but without any ETR subroutine\n- 2 Data Mine, to deal extra damages\n- 2 Chum, that goes well with Data Mine<\/p>\n\n<p>To complete, my agenda points, I take:\n- 2 Corporate War, to maintain a strong economy to be able to rez Janus\n- 2 Private Security Force, even if I only have one way to tag the runner, it will fear him especially if he has already taken a few brain damages.\n- 2 Executive Retreat, to complete and to have a complete new hand.<\/p>\n\n<p>As I said, I need a strong economy to be able to rez my big bad wolf, Janus 1.0. So, I also take:\n- 2 Adonis Campaign\n- 2 Eve Campaign\n- 1 PAD Campaign \n- 3 Green Level Clearance\n- 2 Hedge Fund<\/p>\n\n<p>And finally, I complete my deck with:\n- 2 Edge of World, for extra brain damages and will allow me a double lure with Corporate War that I can install but not advance for a few turns to have enough credits.\n- 2 Ash 2X3ZB9CY, to protect my agendas\n- 1 Corporate Troubleshooter, to boost my brain damage ICEs\n- 1 Hokusai Grid, for extra damages\n- 2 Shipment from MirrorMorph, to boost me at startup or install Data Mine and Chum at the same time.<\/p>\n\n<p>How to play? Except Janus 1.0, we want to keep our ICEs unrezzed til the runner encounter them. And when they are rezzed we trashed them with Security Subcontract and retrieve them with HB retrieval cards.<\/p>\n\n<p>Pros: I think, it is quite a good deck to understand that information is power\nCons: Just 1 Security Subcontract &amp; 2 Archived Memories make it quite weak with just 1 core set.<\/p>\n\n<p>Every comments or insults are welcome.

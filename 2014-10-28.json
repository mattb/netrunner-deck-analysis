As of my first draft here, the deck does not run <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02009\">Plascrete Carapace<\/a>, relying upon <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02050\">Public Sympathy<\/a> and card draw to stave off meat\/net damage. <a href=\"\/en\/card\/03038\">Clone Chip<\/a>s and a one-off <a href=\"\/en\/card\/03035\">Levy AR Lab Access<\/a> can help you recover if you're forced to discard any essential programs or hardware. Also, the <a href=\"\/en\/card\/03038\">Clone Chip<\/a>s are very helpful for memory management, because the deck includes only enough hardware for 9 MU worth of programs, while including a full rig (if you count <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01012\">Parasite<\/a>) that takes up 10 MU.<\/p>\n\n<p>The addition of <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01012\">Parasite<\/a> is an untested new wrinkle following a really rough loss in which Mother Goddess presented an unbreakable wall to my full rig, and it's a generally useful tool in any case. Datasucker tokens really help to manage limited stealth credits during big runs, but it's not mandatory in most cases and isn't a high install priority.<\/p>\n\n<p>I'd love to get feedback on the deck.<\/p>\n","username":"GreatDismal","cards":{"01007":1,"01008":1,"01012":1,"01033":1,"01034":2,"01035":3,"01038":3,"01044":1,"02047":2,"02050":2,"02087":3,"02107":3,"03035":1,"03038":3,"03041":3,"03046":3,"03049":3,"04006":2,"04104":2,"06040":3,"06055":1,"06057":1,"06077":1}},{"id":10284,"name":"quest completed silhouette","creation":"2014-10-28 20:16:20","description":"<p>waiting for cerberus rex to free up influence on a decoder<\/p>\n","username":"notrocketscience","cards":{"01002":2,"01007":2,"01018":2,"01021":3,"01022":3,"01028":2,"01043":1,"01050":3,"02009":2,"02043":2,"02064":2,"02104":3,"03052":2,"03054":1,"04081":2,"05030":1,"05032":2,"05034":2,"05041":1,"05046":1,"05048":2}},{"id":10285,"name":"Data Science","creation":"2014-10-28 20:29:12","description":"<p>Concept deck using Bug and Woman in the red dress to try and make makers eye and legwork strikes as effective as possible.<\/p>\n","username":"Garbo","cards":{"01035":3,"01036":3,"01037":3,"01043":3,"01044":3,"01046":1,"01048":3,"01050":3,"02027":1,"02047":3,"02104":1,"03028":1,"03035":1,"03038":3,"03049":3,"03054":3,"04048":2,"04086":2,"05035":3,"05043":1}},{"id":10286,"name":"Noise Cacheshop","creation":"2014-10-28 20:32:06","description":"<p>This isn't really anything new.

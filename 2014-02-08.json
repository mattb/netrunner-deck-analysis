I bought the core set + the genesis add-ons a few weeks ago. I was looking for examples of decks with these sets but I didn't find what I was looking for. That is why I going to publish a few core+genesis decks. I hope that it will permit me to get better, and to help some other noobs.<\/p>\n\n<p>My aim here, is not having a performing deck for tournaments but a deck with a good card synergy for casual players like me. Let's start with \"HB Engineering the future\" identity.<\/p>\n\n<p>To maximize its power, you just need to install one card by turn. For me, this is a call to play slowly and wisely. If we look at HB cards, we will see that the main archetypes are Bioroid (click advantage) &amp; brain damage. But I don't want to get into them for this deck. What I want is, first, having as less agendas as possible to only have them when I will be quite secure to score them. So I put 8 agendas for 20 points:\n- 2 Accelerated Beta Test (ABT), that will give us an appreciate boost\n- 2 Project Vitruvius, to minimize drawbacks of ABT\n- 3 Priority Requisition, as it has the same behavior of ABT for 3 agenda points each\n- 1 Executive Retreat, as it can useful when having too much agenda in hand<\/p>\n\n<p>I also put:\n- 2 Archived Memories, to minimize drawbacks of ABT\n- 2 Precognition, to maximize ABT\n- 1 Aggressive Secretary, as Precognition will give the runner a good indication about the fact that I will play ABT next turn, but in fact no\n- 2 Adonis Campaign, for economy\n- 2 Eve Campaign, for economy &amp; for parity\n- 3 Green Level Clearance, cause it is damn good\n- 2 Ash 2X3ZB9CY, to protect my agendas\n- 2 Encryption Protocol, to protect my campaigns and other upgrades\n- 2 Shipment from MirrorMorph, cause the boost of the only ABT is for me insufficient and can difficultly arrive on the first 3 turns<\/p>\n\n<p>For ICEs, I put 18, quite well balanced:\n- 3 Eli 1.0, good HB barrier\n- 2 Heimdall 1.0, strong HB barrier\n- 3 Enigma, it fits well with BIOROID\n- 3 Viper, it also fits well with BIOROID\n- 2 Viktor 1.0, HB code gate\n- 2 Archer, it fits well with ATB &amp; Priority Requisition\n- 1 Flare, the all in one\n- 2 Rototurret, cause it seems good to protect the campaigns<\/p>\n\n<p>There is 2 remaining drawbacks here. 1) The fact that we rez ICEs during our turn which gives the runner the information he needs. 2) The order of the ICEs can have an influence one the server's solidity. So I finally add:\n- 1 Corporate Troubleshooter, to answer drawback 1)\n- 2 Experiential Data, to answer drawback 1)\n- 2 Sunset, to answer drawback 2)<\/p>\n\n<p>How to play? The aim is to pass a Shipment from MirrorMorph on the first 3 turns and to score an ABT rapidly to be comfortable and able to manage the rest of the game.<\/p>\n\n<p>Pros: This is for me a good deck to learn HB and its secondary archetypes which are: campaigns, retrieval cards &amp; ICE strengtheners.\nCons: This deck is quite too passive, and let the runner in \"peace\".\nEnhancements: Certainly a lot, cause this is my first deck. I quite unhappy with my sentry ICEs. I found Rototurret weak.<\/p>\n\n<p>Every comments or insults are welcome.

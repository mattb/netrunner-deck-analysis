It wants to play through as much of the deck as you can afford to - clicking for credits only rarely and drawing as many cards as you can as quickly as you can.<\/p>\n\n<p>Basic idea is pretty simple: get to two Link using <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01052\">Access to Globalsec<\/a>, then use a combination of your lots of card draw (<a href=\"\/en\/card\/01034\">Diesel<\/a>, <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02087\">Quality Time<\/a>) and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04004\">Hostage<\/a> to draw out your three copies of <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02069\">Underworld Contact<\/a>. Now you have reliable recurring cash.<\/p>\n\n<p>Ice tends towards the expensive side, but that's mitigated by using the <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02047\">Test Run<\/a>\/<a href=\"\/en\/card\/03034\">Scavenge<\/a> trick; thanks to your identity, this nets you at least one and possibly two cards (depending on where the program starts). If you're having trouble drawing enough of one or the other of those (you will), you can use <a href=\"\/en\/card\/03054\">Same Old Thing<\/a> to fill in the gaps.<\/p>\n\n<p>Everything else is there either in support of those two goals. <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02091\">Kati Jones<\/a> gives you one recurring source of cash, in addition to your 3 credits\/turn, and can also be fetched by a <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04004\">Hostage<\/a> if need be; with seven non-redundant Connections in the deck, <a href=\"\/en\/card\/05031\">Calling in Favors<\/a> made good sense.

Run often.<\/p>\n\n<p>Quetzal's ability lets us play Anarchs like we would Criminals, so get that early pressure on those servers using any number of nasty tricks, and run them again as soon as you can with Same Old Thing. The hallmark Anarch disruption cards are in here in the form of Keyhole, Parasite, and Demo Run, and we can pressure across the board with Knight\/Overmind\/D4v1d all comboed with e3. A notable omission is Datasucker, but this deck doesn't have too much trouble dealing with middling ice (those pesky 4 strengthers), so I've always found it best to just plop down a Parasite and wait for it to tick away. Worst case scenario, you'll force the corp to cede tempo with a virus wipe.<\/p>\n\n<p>Hades Shard has been a bone of contention for this deck, and I'm still torn as to whether it needs to run in here. For now though, it's in because of how darn well it synergizes with Keyhole. The trade-off here is that e3 is down to only two copies, but I've had success with this deck even when you see the e3's late, so I'd rather leave that 2 influence for the Hades and a Net Celebrity (Cerebral Static is a nightmare for this deck).<\/p>\n\n<p>D4v1d is down to two copies to allow room for two Plascretes.

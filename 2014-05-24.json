Don't give away what Mr. Li offers you...<\/p>\n\n<p>End game: There are three possible ways to end the game, depending on the ICE and ICE depth on Archives as well as Agenda development of the croporation.\n1. Pump Crypsis, then make a run on Archives. Normally you will sit on 20+credits, so this should not be the problem. Swordsman gives you the middle finger, so in case you know the corp plays it you should have a second Crypsis as backup.\n2. Deck the corp. This will take about 2 or 3 turns longer than the first possibility, so use it only when the corp is not on matchpoint.<\/p>\n","username":"sarathas","cards":{"01019":3,"01030":3,"01031":1,"01051":3,"01052":3,"02009":2,"02042":1,"02069":3,"02103":3,"02105":3,"02109":3,"03053":3,"03055":1,"04004":3,"04009":1,"04062":1,"04089":3,"04106":3,"05028":1,"05037":2}},{"id":5975,"name":"NBN #3 - Restructuring News v2","creation":"2014-05-24 07:07:35","description":"<p>===== v2 =====\n-2 MMC\n-3 Celebrity Gift\n-1 Draco\n-3 Pop-up Window\n+2 Scorched Earth \n+3 Sweeps Week\n+2 Muckraker\n+2 Data Raven\n===== =====<\/p>\n\n<p>1) Cheap ices early on to be able to play Restructure.

FOA and Emergency Shutdown really change importance depending on the matchup you're facing, so not sure how I should adjust that composition.<\/p>\n\n<p>I try to avoid going tag-me since Mr. Li is such a great way to find what you need earlier and to control how much money you want to draw right now. That is so useful I even prefer to use the first Hostage on Mr. Li instead of Kati Jones. \nMaybe including Mr. Li and Kati Jones is against the spirit of an event based deck and they don't permit me to keep tags and force me to include the otherwise useless Hostages, but I found they are a really important part of this deck.<\/p>\n","username":"Eijolend","cards":{"01007":1,"01018":3,"01020":1,"01021":1,"01022":3,"01024":3,"01026":1,"01027":1,"01036":1,"01043":1,"01050":3,"02009":2,"02043":1,"02083":1,"02091":1,"02104":3,"02105":1,"03035":1,"03052":3,"03054":3,"04004":2,"04029":3,"04063":1,"04109":2,"05035":1,"05036":2}},{"id":5994,"name":"Psionic Scorcha' Killa'","creation":"2014-05-24 18:41:49","description":"<p>Hey there,<\/p>\n\n<p>This is a deck I've been having loads of fun playing with so far.

Just seems appropriate because everything is cheap so it allows for more card slots with easy burst econ. In this deck bluffing is very important so Celebrity Gift may actually harm as much as help.<\/p>\n\n<p>-Neural EMP: mandatory, can't picture this kind of flatline archetype without it<\/p>\n\n<p>-Scorched earth: the big debate here was whether or not to put 3 and through testing it works best to get one as early as possible.<\/p>\n\n<p>ICE<\/p>\n\n<p>Ok this is slightly trickier, It's still up for debate which ICE is best to use and the deck doesn't pack a huge punch (especially against RnD locks).

Nasir loves to facecheck, and the Dagger build allows you to do so safely. With so many recurring credits, you shouldn't have any issues with losing your credit pool.

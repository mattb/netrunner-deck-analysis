Gone are the 3xForged Activation Orders, 2xDinosaurus, 2xKati Jones, 1xProfessional Contact, and 2xAtman. With Dagger as my main breaker, I saw myself just running rather than burning time on Forge Activation Orders. MU was often a problem and hoping to get Dinosaurus set up too long for the aggressive deck. The Mem Chips and Spinal Modem fixed that easily. Atmans for Gordian and Snowball were no brainers. Make the backup breakers useful for a lot of things rather than just a few cards. And turn off Wraparound. \nEconomy was also an issue in the original, as Paintbrush was so click intensive and I never had time for Kati Jones. You need drip or burst economy for this deck, so in came three Daily Casts and one Lucky Find.\nI'm still messing with this idea and I have a second direction using Toolbox, Rabbithole, Underworld contacts, and a few other small changes.<\/p>\n","username":"KingOfOdonata","cards":{"01033":1,"01034":3,"01035":2,"01037":3,"01043":1,"01050":3,"02002":2,"02009":2,"02027":1,"02047":3,"02088":2,"02107":2,"03041":3,"03042":3,"03046":1,"03049":2,"03053":3,"04086":2,"04104":3,"04108":3,"04109":1}},{"id":4379,"name":"Haas's Digital Fortress v7 (4-0 Ench.

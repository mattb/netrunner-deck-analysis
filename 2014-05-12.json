While that deck had me go 6-0, including the eventual loss in Top 8 (I won the Corp side, but my Runner deck was definitely subpar), this deck tries to cut out the non-Bioroid ICE and give my defenses a much needed upgrade.<\/p>\n\n<p>This deck, like its predecessor, has no tricks; the deck is purely an Agenda Factory. While some might think only having one win condition makes the deck too narrow, you more than make up for the weakness by the strength of your ICE, as well as the increasingly annoying Caprice\/Ash combo. They can blow all their resources getting in, only to lose to Caprice; and if they guess correctly on Caprice, Ash has a near guaranteed chance to give them restricted access.<\/p>\n\n<p>Because of the inclusion of more Bioroids, I cut a Pri-Req and added a Project Wotan. There's only two pieces of ICE that aren't affected by it, but they're Tollbooth so they don't need any other bonuses.<\/p>\n\n<p>The early game is going to revolve around Eli 1.0 and either Viktor. You can play Adonis and Eve unprotected; make them waste the resources. If you fear Bank Job or desperately need the credits, keep Adonis behind one ICE. Eve isn't worth protecting; the 5 trash cost is enough of a deterrent in most cases. If you stick a Melange and use it for 1-3 turns, you're set on credits for the rest of the game.<\/p>\n\n<p>Hudson is the only yet untested card in this deck. My original train of thought was to surprise the Runner if they decided to Maker's Eye\/R&amp;D Interface. A 6 strength code gate is basically guaranteed to get clicked through, but if they're wasting 3\/4 of their turn on that then it's almost beneficial.<\/p>\n\n<p>Even when the Runner has their suite out late-game, you'll find that as you've been installing ICE on your servers (and outside of the 3 centrals, you'll have 2 remotes with ICE at the absolute most) them clicking through the first couple Bioroid ICEs still makes each run expensive as hell. That's when Caprice\/Ash come in big. Keep them out, score your points, win. The formula still works.<\/p>\n\n<p>I realize that this deck still has its weaknesses; Magnum Opus can neutralize a lot of defenses, and the new Unregistered S&amp;W ends Caprice and Ash. But Magnum Opus still takes time, and the gun takes them an entire turn if they take out both upgrades to a server. The deck can definitely push through those cards.<\/p>\n","username":"Halarith","cards":{"01055":3,"01056":3,"01061":2,"01062":2,"01063":3,"01090":2,"01106":2,"01108":2,"01110":3,"02010":1,"02013":2,"02051":1,"02092":2,"02110":3,"03006":2,"03015":2,"03017":2,"03019":3,"04015":3,"04030":1,"04040":3,"04051":1,"04114":2}},{"id":5471,"name":"No molona para pofesionales.","creation":"2014-05-12 01:11:47","description":"<p>Lo se lo se el metajuego no favorece ni el brain damage ni el faroleo y menos las barajas que se exceden del limite de cartas...<\/p>\n","username":"titonosfe","cards":{"01061":1,"01067":1,"01070":2,"01072":2,"01073":1,"01075":2,"01078":2,"01092":1,"01106":2,"01108":1,"01110":3,"02012":1,"02014":3,"02053":1,"03017":1,"04012":3,"04015":2,"04059":1,"04073":3,"04111":1,"04114":2,"04115":2,"04120":1,"05004":3,"05005":3,"05006":1,"05011":2,"05012":1,"05016":3,"05017":2,"05020":1}},{"id":5472,"name":"Regionals: NBN Program Trashing","creation":"2014-05-12 02:32:05","description":"\n","username":"bewnt","cards":{"01062":2,"01081":3,"01082":3,"01084":2,"01092":2,"01110":3,"02056":3,"02114":1,"02115":3,"03023":1,"04015":3,"04020":2,"04058":3,"04076":3,"04077":2,"04096":3,"04119":1,"04120":3,"05016":1,"05027":1}},{"id":5473,"name":"Regionals: Good Knight Gabe","creation":"2014-05-12 02:32:43","description":"\n","username":"bewnt","cards":{"01007":1,"01008":3,"01014":1,"01017":1,"01018":3,"01021":2,"01022":3,"01024":2,"01026":1,"01028":3,"01029":2,"01050":3,"01053":2,"02009":2,"02043":3,"02104":3,"02106":1,"03052":3,"03054":2,"04043":3,"05036":2}},{"id":5474,"name":"Good Guy Jinteki","creation":"2014-05-12 03:44:08","description":"<p>I made this deck by request from a friend and it actually turned out to be quite a fun deck!

I haven't found a great way to incorporate central breakers without giving up entirely on remotes, which I think is poor strategy.  This is the version I've currently been poking around OCTGN with, so you may've seen it in some form or another the past week or two if you played me.<\/p>\n\n<p>Choice of ID is Andromeda for this one, mainly for smoothing out the draws as this deck requires more moving pieces than a standard criminal and you really need the deeper draw off the bat.  The other main contender is Ken Tenma, as this deck is influence hungry and 2 more pips could be quite useful.<\/p>\n\n<p>The main theme of this deck is utilizing keyhole instead of other R&amp;D multi-access like Interface or Indexing (Medium is dead to me out of faction).  Here are what I think are the strengths of Keyhole.  It keeps the corp offbalance, the constant shuffling means their top three cards are never safe, the pressure is non-stop unlike say an indexing or 3 deep interface run where the runner whiffs.  Second, it lets you trash out combo cards.  This is getting more important as decks like CI Combo or Accelerated Diagnostics become more powerful.  Trashing key cards can be the difference between victory and defeat against these decks.  Your counter is still Jackson Howard, but I think it is countered less than say indexing which is entirely wasted if they use Jackson to shuffle whereas Keyhole is still on the table.  Putting agendas into archives also pressures the corp to use Howard's ability earlier and not on the cards they would've preferred to recur.  It also makes overdrawing and dumping agendas less attractive as they need to save his ability for agendas you plan to mill.<\/p>\n\n<p>The downside obviously is the 2 mem investment, which requires the deck to be built around handling it alongside 3 breakers.  The heavy influence investment in breakers and keyhole pushed me to use a ProCo based economy, as all the cards that go with it are influence neutral and Hostage gives us a readily available way to find it at not too much additional tax.  The rest of the econ is fairly self-explained, Kati, Gambles, Easy Mark, Dirty Laundry, Siphon, and Prepaid VoicePAD.  The deck has enough costed events that the VoicePADs come in handy as well as guarding our Corroder from an unkind fate via Power Shutdown.<\/p>\n\n<p>The rest of it is fairly Criminal Standard.  Bringing the new Legwork seems optimal to give us as many multi-hand accesses as possible to complement our Keyhole.  I decided to bring in a trick Inside Job and use Planned Assault as a way to fetch Siphon, Legwork, or the Inside Job on command.<\/p>\n\n<p>Constructive criticism, especially from people who tried the deck, is always welcome.<\/p>\n","username":"Flashfires","cards":{"01007":2,"01018":3,"01019":2,"01021":1,"01022":3,"01024":3,"01026":1,"01043":1,"01050":3,"02009":2,"02083":1,"02091":2,"02104":3,"03049":1,"03052":3,"03053":3,"04004":3,"04029":2,"04061":2,"05035":3,"05036":2}},{"id":5478,"name":"Parasite Kate","creation":"2014-05-12 08:59:34","description":"\n","username":"Tenereos","cards":{"01006":1,"01008":3,"01012":3,"01026":2,"01033":1,"01050":3,"02009":3,"02047":3,"02066":1,"02091":3,"02106":3,"03035":1,"03038":3,"03040":2,"03046":3,"03048":1,"03052":2,"03053":3,"03054":3,"04086":1,"05036":1}},{"id":5479,"name":"Smash and Grab V.2","creation":"2014-05-12 09:11:11","description":"<p>First real attempt at a serious deck, only have data packs up to C&amp;C.

(disclaimer: my brain is mush by this point)<\/p>\n\n<p>~~~<\/p>\n\n<p>AGENDAS<\/p>\n\n<p>Nisei Mk. II - the best agenda possible for this deck. The ability to stop siphons is powerful by itself, but with Ruhr + Caprice it becomes horrifying: even if the runner beats the Caprice psi game, in 4.3 you can use a scored token to end the run. (Optional step 4.3.1: laugh bitterly). <\/p>\n\n<p>NAPD contract - The 4 cost is a big advantage in a taxing deck, and has won me a game on more than one occasion. I tried replacing it it with 2x braintrust, 1x philotic, and then 3x medical breakthrough, but didn't like it quite so much. <\/p>\n\n<p>Future Perfect - There's nothing quite so annoying as a three point agenda you can't score. It's also nice to have a chunky points card to close out the game once you have the scoring server set up.<\/p>\n\n<p>Fetal AI - a splash to kill the folks who think it's clever to run through komainu with no cards in their hand. <\/p>\n\n<p>~~~<\/p>\n\n<p>ASSETS<\/p>\n\n<p>Jhow - recur parasited ice or economy cards. Dig for the combo. Dig for Nisei. <\/p>\n\n<p>Shi.Kyu - I found this underwhelming. Ideally it stops the runner from winning by scoring three agendas, unless they score both future perfects. Often that never happens. <\/p>\n\n<p>Health Clinic - The 0 rez is amazing. Give the runner a huge handsize and watch them cry when they encounter Komainu.\n.\nSundew - in RP? 'nuff said.<\/p>\n\n<p>~~~<\/p>\n\n<p>UPGRADES<\/p>\n\n<p>Caprice + Ruhr. The heart of the combo. Think carefully before putting caprice on HQ or R&amp;D unless you have a spare in the early game. The only time I wouldn't use these in a remote is vs. a Quest Completed\/Notoriety deck. In that match up, put the combo on HQ or R&amp;D to deny them their power cards.<\/p>\n\n<p>~~~<\/p>\n\n<p>OPERATIONS<\/p>\n\n<p>You will want to rez a lot of ice. This means you need a lot of money. The combo itself costs 8, too. So there's that. <\/p>\n\n<p>Hedge Fund - money is good!<\/p>\n\n<p>Celebrity GIft - a tough card to play early game - information is valuable. I would consider dropping to 2 to add in something else.<\/p>\n\n<p>Fundraiser - OK. So, a lot of people see me running this in a taxing Jinteki RP and go, huh? Some thoughts:<\/p>\n\n<p>1) It is usually better to give your opponent 3 credits <em>if<\/em> it will let you rez one of your really taxing ice - Tsurugi or Komainu - because it costs them to get through, and gets your ice rezzed on all three centrals, which you want to do ASAP. <\/p>\n\n<p>2)It's a great recovery card. A restructure you can play at 3cr is not to be sniffed at. Because you're rezzing ice all the time, you're not going to have 10cr lying around for long.  <\/p>\n\n<p>3) It combos well with Closed Accounts.<\/p>\n\n<p>4) You have to be <em>so<\/em> careful when you play this. Don't give a poor runner money. 3cr can let them steal an NAPD or play psi games they would be otherwise too broke to afford.<\/p>\n\n<p>Closed Accounts - amazing splash vs. criminals who keep their tags. Creates a scoring window out of nowhere.<\/p>\n\n<p>~~~<\/p>\n\n<p>ICE<\/p>\n\n<p>This deck is mostly all about the taxing ice. Though the biggest taxers here are weak to parasite, one of the upsides of my ice choice is that datasucker counters (without parasite) become pretty much useless. Eli is their only target. <\/p>\n\n<p>Eli 1.0 - great for remotes, or the bottom ice of R&amp;D. Clicks are so important vs. RP that not breaking this with $ helps you out a lot.<\/p>\n\n<p>Komainu - My fave ice in this deck. Terrible vs. parasite, but otherwise taxes the runner beautifully. Encourages them to run with few cards, which lets you hit them with Shi.Kyu. <\/p>\n\n<p>Tsurugi - Amazing ice for taxation. Best friends with Pup and Komainu if the runner thinks they can save $ by ditching cards. <\/p>\n\n<p>Pup - good early card on R&amp;D or Archives, and pretty nice to play out on a Sundew in a remote.<\/p>\n\n<p>Chimera - hard ETR in the early game, use it when you need it. I like it at the base of HQ behind a taxing ice, so I can rez it vs. siphon vs. crims. Good for the remote server vs. central breakers. Doubles as good early Sundew protection. <\/p>\n\n<p>Enigma - one of the few cards with a hard ETR; RP loves ice that makes the runner lose clicks. <\/p>\n\n<p>~~~<\/p>\n","username":"pruneface","cards":{"01068":3,"01084":1,"01110":3,"01111":3,"02031":1,"02032":1,"02060":2,"02110":3,"02111":3,"04012":3,"04015":1,"04054":3,"04074":3,"04114":3,"04119":3,"05007":2,"05009":3,"05011":1,"05014":3,"05017":3,"05018":2}},{"id":5495,"name":"Mushin No Shit v2","creation":"2014-05-12 17:30:55","description":"<p>Originally made this as a bit of a fun deck but it's proven to be surprisingly strong, combining what I think are the best elements of NBN and Jinteki - fake-outs, porous but unpleasant ice and that sweet, sweet fast-advance.

The aim remains the same, to Astrochain to victory, usually Astro-Astro-Beale-Breaking News. Fast Track enables you to thin your deck of actual agendas. It also makes running 44 cards more attractive than the usual 40 cards, as neither your hand nor your deck are particularly profitable for the runner in terms of agenda points. It's primary use is to pull out agendas ready to score next turn, and hide them in your 6 card hand. With an Astroscript counter and either an installed SanSan or Biotic in hand, you can Fast Track to score another Astroscript from deck. FROM THE DECK! Madness.<\/p>\n\n<p>As with Astrobiotics, the deck suffers the longer the game goes on, due to the binary nature of a good portion of the ice. There's a few taxing heavy-hitters like Grim and Tollbooth, but both are hugely hurt by Emergency Shutdown. Once you get past Turn 10, the odds of winning with this deck start to plummet. The key is knowing when to rez ice and when to let the runner through. If you've got the money and the means to get the Astrotrain rolling, 90% of the time the right call is to allow the Runner access and pray to Lady Luck.<\/p>\n\n<p>One final comment about Fast Track - when I explained the deck to people at the tournament, they asked me how many copies of Fast Track I was running. Most assumed 2, but seemed shocked when I said 3. In response, I find that over the course of a single game I will often think 3 times or more after mandatory drawing an agenda \"man, I wish I had drawn an Astroscript instead of a Beale right now\" or else \"man, I wish I hadn't drawn an agenda right now.\" Drawing a Fast Track solves both of those headaches with a single card. 3 copies is the right call, I'm sure of it.<\/p>\n\n<hr \/>\n\n<p>Card choices<\/p>\n\n<p>2x Eli 1.0 - During testing I switched between 2 Rototurrets, 2 Elis and one of each. What I discovered was that a Rototurret is only useful if it comes out early enough to knock out a key program, but Eli is nice draw at any point in the game, and remains an annoyance for the runner long after Corroder hits the table. Factor in the reduced rez cost and Grim as a backup destroyer, and 2x Eli was the best choice of the options.<\/p>\n\n<p>2x Grim - Speaking of Grim, it was the standout card at the Worcester Store Championships where I placed second. After dropping the Rototurret from my deck, I increased the Grim count to 2. It comes as a real surprise to many people who don't expect such a nasty piece of ice in what otherwise looks to be a bog standard Fast Advance deck, and is quite taxing to get through for anyone relying on Mimic or Femme with a singleton Datasucker as support. It has anti-synergy with NAPD contract, but only if you are looking to score NAPD contract, which I rarely am.<\/p>\n\n<p>2x Green Level Clearance - A deck-building restriction I set myself is to run as many economy cards as agendas, so with the standard Hedge\/Sweeps forming the backbone, I had 4 more card slots. After thinking about what I liked and didn't like in my Store Championships deck, I remembered that the GLC was always a welcome sight. It also fits the deck style of keeping a high hand size to dissuade the runner from unprofitable HQ runs. Add those in and I've got 8 economy cards...<\/p>\n\n<p>2x Pop-Up Window - And Pop-Up Window forms the final two. I consider Pop-Up an economy card because I'm often putting it on R&amp;D, and many runners are content to run through it every turn to see what I've got on top of my deck. It also enables one of my favourite plays, which is to protect HQ with a Pop-Up Window and then Fast Track out an Astroscript. Many runners will run 4 times to try and take it from hand. Sometimes they will succeed, but oftentimes they won't. Regardless, I just got a Hedge Fund's worth of cash for installing that Pop Up. It's also a great card against Kit, a taxing code gate that shields the barriers and sentries deeper in the server.<\/p>\n\n<p>2x Chimera - Speaking of HQ ice, Chimera is my favourite. As the ultimate gear check ice, it really keeps those AI-less criminal decks searching for breakers before they can get the Siphon chain going. Often you are better off not rezzing it to bait out the SIphon, but it pulls double duty when you've just Fast Tracked a key agenda and you really need to keep it safe.<\/p>\n\n<p>1x RSVP - Usually used to protect a SanSan for cheap, but can also double up as protection to score an early NAPD contract.<\/p>\n\n<p>1x Guard - Guard is a wonderful anti-criminal card. It has two uses, the first is to try and score an agenda behind it in the early game, safe in the knowledge that it'll take more than an Inside Job to get the runner in. The other use is after they've installed a Faerie, to put a SanSan, Jackson or NAPD contract behind it to bait them to use the Faerie for little to no gain, and then try to use a Grim to its full effect. At worst it's an expensive ETR ice for your centrals, which is better than nothing if you are ice-starved.<\/p>\n\n<p>1x Shipment from SanSan - \"They can't score an Astroscript this turn, they're 2 credits shor... oh.\" I rarely use this card if I could use credits to score, which means I don't really view it as an economy card. This card is more about enabling plays where you convince the runner to take credits, draw cards, or run anywhere but my hand while they presume I can't score an agenda from hand. It also helps to make Account Siphon less of a threat.<\/p>\n\n<p>1x Corporate Shuffle - at best, it resets my hand in the middle of the game, usually just after I've just scored my first Astroscript. At about this time, my hand is often full of a good bit of chaff - ice that is doing very little for me and agendas I'm not looking to score. At worst, it's a third mulligan.<\/p>\n\n<p>1x Closed Accounts - if you don't run any tag punishment, you're asking to be Siphon-chained. Make them care about tags and you will often buy yourself enough time to just about push the Astrochain out the station.<\/p>\n\n<hr \/>\n\n<p>Matchups<\/p>\n\n<p>Siphon Andromeda - The deck holds up well against the most common runner build, so long as it can score the first Astroscript before the Siphon chain hits. I'm quite happy to hover at 2 credits and score with Astro-counters. Legwork is a pain, but it still only gives them a 50-50 shot at pulling out the agenda you just Fast-Tracked. Sometimes you've got to roll the hard six.<\/p>\n\n<p>Whizzard - Not a huge problem since you don't run any asset economy, and SanSan is usually used as a bait to get the runner to spend money and clicks. This play doesn't hurt Whizzard as hard as it does other runners, but then Whizzard is slower than the other runners.<\/p>\n\n<p>Noise - mostly untested, but I would imagine it's a difficult matchup. A lot of the ice dies to parasite, and losing a Biotic to a random virus mill or an Imp can be game-changing. The singleton Jackson reflects the lack of Noise in competitive play, but respects his ability to ruin your day.<\/p>\n\n<p>Gabe Knight - There's enough cheap ice to make overwriting the Knighted Ice a possibility, without too much of an economic hit. You always have to plan for the eventual Sneakdoor, a Grim will do nicely but any ETR will work in a pinch.<\/p>\n\n<p>Chaos Theory Turbo Rig - Test Run \/ Scavenging big breaker CT is one of the fastest runner decks out there, but this deck is faster. The more multi-access they are packing the more difficult the matchup will be.<\/p>\n\n<p>Katman - probably the deck's worst matchup. All of the ice that matters is at strength 0 or 4, which makes both Parasite and a Str-4 Atman real problem programs. Wraparound can save the day by necessitating they find a Fracter or use a tutor for it, which can buy you enough time to get going.<\/p>\n\n<hr \/>\n\n<p>At the regional this deck went 3-2 in the swiss rounds (effectively 4-2 due to a Store Championship bye) and undefeated in the knockout rounds. The first loss was due to an agenda flood, and the second due to almost all of my agendas coming out before I saw a single Fast Track (and my R&amp;D was locked hard). In the other three swiss games and the knockouts the deck ran smooth as silk, and was especially on form in the final game, where I pulled out a Turn 8 victory against Andromeda.

The point of the deck is to tax the runner with cheap ice and advance agendas though mushin no shin and trick of light. While randomly killing a player if they make a mistake.\nA mushin no shin on a junebug will out right flat line a runner. use that to your advantage when setting up plays. If they don't check it, it could be a Ronin - equally as dangerous. Use failed traps and ice walls as advancement batteries for your trick of light plays.<br \/>\nEach ice taxes the runner 1 to 2 clicks per run (even with icebreakers) while costing me very little to set up.\nEvery agenda also taxes the runner in some way - let them take a few if necessary.<\/p>\n\n<p>The cerebral casts - if they take the brain damage every thing is that much more lethal. If they take the tag kill their resources or scorch them.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>Thinking about running 1 fast track as Philotic Entanglement is a beast when paired with trick of light fast advance.<\/em><\/p>\n","username":"Lastmemori","cards":{"01067":1,"01069":2,"01070":2,"01075":2,"01077":2,"01099":2,"01103":3,"01110":3,"02032":2,"02033":3,"02056":3,"02112":2,"04012":3,"04093":2,"04119":3,"05004":2,"05005":3,"05006":1,"05013":3,"05015":3,"05018":3}},{"id":5504,"name":"Sonic the Clone","creation":"2014-05-12 22:42:53","description":"<p>RUN ALL THE PLACES<\/p>\n","username":"proxy","cards":{"01007":2,"01008":3,"01011":1,"01014":1,"01018":3,"01021":3,"01022":3,"01024":3,"01036":2,"01050":3,"01053":2,"02009":3,"02087":1,"02104":3,"02106":1,"03052":3,"03054":3,"05029":1,"05035":1,"05036":2,"05048":2}},{"id":5505,"name":"Overmind Kate","creation":"2014-05-12 23:46:17","description":"<p>Played this at league tonight and it was a beast.

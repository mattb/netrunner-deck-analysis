This version is really good late game since agendas scored early can strengthen your lategame.<\/p>\n\n<p>Early game: given a good starting hand there should be no problem protecting your first remote server. Try to advance your first agenda without wasting too many resources.<\/p>\n\n<p>Mid game: as long as you have some kind of a save server continue pushing agendas through. Also start defending your R&amp;D better,  you never want to be R&amp;D locked. Also scoring Efficiency Comittee is really strong.<\/p>\n\n<p>End game: this really depends on what you scored up to this point.

While this isn't a \"Tier 1\" competitive deck for demolishing the field at Gencon, you should easily be able to win more than you lose with him. <\/p>\n\n<p>The general idea is to be able to pressure every server with multi card access. The key is, like a Criminal runner, to use Faerie (or more usually Self Modifying Code->Faerie) to run consequence free even after you've started assembling your rig. Similarly always keep in mind how many credits you need to bring out Deus Ex either with SMC(5) or a Clone Chip(3) for a surpise Janus or other AP ICE. You don't have multiple copies of your breakers so program destruction hurts you more than anybody. Yes you can (and should) Clone Chip back key programs but you only get 3x of those so use them wisely.<\/p>\n\n<p>This is a virus heavy 2x Data sucker archetype, so you definitely want to get Djinn out early... not least because Djinn can host an SMC even once you have some breakers out. Sahasrara really helps with program installation so getting that on your Djinn as well can really speed up getting to Big Rig status.  Don't forget that an SMC and a Clone Chip is functionally equivalent to 2x SMC.<\/p>\n\n<p>Besides program destruction, Power Shutdown is probably your biggest enemy... not because of allegedly broken combos, but because most of your important cards are low cost. Against Weyland it's worth holding SMC or Clone Chips in hand until you are ready to use them.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Modded is an important card for this deck because of its Professional Contacts draw\/economy engine. Not only do you have a lot of targets for Modded, but it also clears 2 cards out of your hand, allowing you to hit Pro Con harder. Modded also, especially with Sahasrara installed, makes cards like Femme and Morning Star playable outside the lovable Test Run->Scavenge combo.<\/p>\n","username":"JWHamner","cards":{"01007":1,"01008":2,"01009":1,"01010":1,"01011":1,"01012":1,"01014":1,"01026":1,"01028":1,"01035":3,"01038":3,"01050":3,"02003":1,"02004":1,"02009":2,"02041":1,"02047":2,"02048":2,"02066":1,"02091":2,"02104":1,"03029":1,"03034":2,"03038":3,"03046":3,"03047":1,"03049":3,"04061":1}},{"id":1639,"name":"Off the Grid behind two skyscrapers .2","creation":"2014-01-22 12:08:57","description":"<p>This is a design I made that is so far undefeated (around 15 plays, I know it's not a lot)<\/p>\n\n<p>It is not a classic FA deck.

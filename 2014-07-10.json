For a full explanation of the deck go here:<\/p>\n\n<p>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=lj94DCNkBhg<\/p>\n\n<p>You pretty much need to abolish traditional corp strategies when playing this deck.  It is a different animal.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Here is the focus of the deck.  Make them lose their cards anyway possible.  Once runners hand is low on cards, use these as windows to score agendas, especially Fetal AI.  Otherwise you can Trick of Light easily for points, and also play the game of laying 3 remotes in a turn, one(usually) being an agenda.  I prefer not to do that, but often times it is very effective, and you need to be ready to do it if the timing is right.  That is the benefit of playing ***Braintrust, and other 3\/X agendas. <\/p>\n\n<p>Knowing how to read your opponent is very important to make this deck work optimally.  Use their tendencies against them.  This is where the name of the deck comes from.  Find their soft spot and exploit them.  If they are checking every face down card, play a lot of assets in remotes.  If they are timid, casually score in empty remotes.  Most runners will be somewhere in between, and will fluctuate within the game.  Find the \"rhythm\" of the game, and stay one step ahead of the runner.  As an example, some players have a tendency to run HQ a lot, or are inexplicably in love with playing Legwork against this deck.  I will make sure I keep traps in hand versus archives or remotes to ensure I will punish them.  Additionally, I might do things like advance an ICE wall twice just so they think I might be getting ready to fast advance, but really it's baiting them to run and hopefully Legwork the hand.  There are a lot of \"plays\" in the \"playbook\".  It's very sadistic and fun to toy with the runner.<\/p>\n\n<p>House of Knives just compounds all of this, opens up more scoring windows, and has the enormous benefit of flexibility of when you want to use it.  No need to be reckless with the counters if you can use them to help score you more points.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Once you master finding or creating windows to score, you can be deadly with this deck.  You will always be a threat to flatline, and scoring will obviously just force the runner to take more risks.  This is when the deck shines the most, as there is a small margin of error for the runner.<\/p>\n\n<p>I think this deck is all the mind games without a lot risk of losing time and money into wasted traps.  All and all, it is a very fun and competitive deck.  I hope you all enjoy it as much as I have.<\/p>\n\n<p>***Important to note that I think the deck is better with Braintrust instead of Medical Breakthrough.  Some would argue differently, but I prefer the the ease always being able to score a Braintrust.  I just am not sure how to make any changes to the deck once it's published, otherwise I would change that.<\/p>\n","username":"Nordrunner","cards":{"01058":2,"01067":1,"01070":3,"01076":3,"01099":1,"01103":2,"01104":2,"01110":3,"02032":3,"02033":3,"02095":3,"04015":3,"04073":3,"04093":3,"05004":3,"05005":3,"05006":1,"05007":1,"05011":3,"05014":1,"05022":3}},{"id":7522,"name":"HBFA - Platinum Edition","creation":"2014-07-10 01:45:13","description":"<p>I am excited to show everyone this deck.  I can count on 1\/2 of a hand how many games I have lost with this deck (@spags grrrrr).<\/p>\n\n<p>I believe this is HBFA at it's finest.  All ETR ICE, plenty of program trashing, taxing ICE (NEXT adds up!!!), lots of draw, money, and recursion.  Total recipe for winning.<\/p>\n\n<p>In the past, \"HBFA\" was more like \"HBS(low)A\".  Having to always wait for Adonis and\/or Eve to trickle away until a scoring server was usable.  With cards like Blue Level and Green Level, you can make money while you seek out the cards you need.  You are able to shorten the game quite a bit if you can make money while you draw cards.  Score behind ETR barriers and code gates and once they get their breaker, kill it with Archer and\/or Roto.  Using Domestic Sleepers for Archer is optimal, but even saccing a 2 pointer if often worth it if it opens a major scoring window.  Fast track will help you leverage these scoring windows and archived memories is there for biotics, SanSan, Fast Tracks, or anything else you may need.<\/p>\n\n<p>It is a fabulous deck if you play it fast and aggressive.

If it is an agenda, either go for it directly using Crypsis or backdoor it using Quest Completed.<\/p>\n\n<p>I feel like there is plenty of economy for consistent running, especially given the efficiency of the 'centrals only' breaker suite.   <\/p>\n\n<p>I would like to cut 5 cards out of the deck, but I don't know that I can and do everything I think needs to happen for the rig to come out quickly.  I'm also debating putting in Keyhole instead of the R&amp;D interfaces.  Downside is that I don't have the influence to splash 2 of them and I won't be able to tutor for it.<\/p>\n","username":"Castings","cards":{"01004":2,"01018":3,"01020":2,"01021":3,"01022":3,"01050":3,"01051":1,"02009":2,"02026":2,"02043":2,"02064":2,"02066":1,"02091":1,"02107":2,"03049":1,"03053":3,"03054":3,"04004":2,"04081":2,"05030":1,"05033":2,"05041":1,"05042":1,"05046":1}},{"id":7546,"name":"Vivat Academia","creation":"2014-07-10 19:30:37","description":"<p>Be flexible, be dangerous. No, you don't need <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01018\">Account Siphon<\/a> to be a badass. Why <a href=\"\/en\/card\/03029\">The Professor: Keeper of Knowledge<\/a>? Because no-one else can run the spread of programs that he can, and not running three copies of some silly blue event card is a small enough price to pay for that flexibility :)<\/p>\n\n<p>By virtue of the cards included, this deck's biggest strength is that you can morph into different kinds of runner setups, based on what you're playing against. <\/p>\n\n<p>You can be any of the following:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>AtmanSucker<\/li>\n<li>Parasite Recursion<\/li>\n<li>Big Rig<\/li>\n<li>Deep RnD dig<\/li>\n<li>Anarch with actual tutoring<\/li>\n<li>Remote control-focused build<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>MVP: Scavenge<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>It might not look like it, and you probably won't believe it until you play a bunch of The Prof, but Scavenge is super-useful. It basically allows you to phase out bits of your rig as they stop being useful, transforming them into something more so. My favorite plays often involve things like playing a Sneakdoor, milking it for all it's worth, then Scavenging it into an Opus for 1 measly credit. Also great when you morph early pressure programs into actual breakers you'll need later. Of course, the old standby Test Run\/Scavenge is still available, for tasty targets like Femme, Morning Star and Keyhole. <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Honorable Mention: Modded<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Modded is so awesome because it allows you to be much more reckless with your money, delaying the Opus play (which is both a memory hog and makes destroyers a problem). Installing Opus from 2 credits is much easier than doing so from 5. Or, you could look at it this way: you'll be installing stuff anyway, right? This is like a Dirty Laundry that doesn't need a successful run and doesn't actually cost you money some of the time. <\/p>\n\n<p>Oh, one last tip - if you play The Prof and draw a memory card, and are tempted to ditch it because \"you won't need that anytime soon\"... <strong>do yourself a favor and don't<\/strong>. Professor is gated more by memory than by anything else. If you play that Mem Chip instead of discarding it, you'll be glad two turns later, believe me.<\/p>\n","username":"PeekaySK","cards":{"01007":1,"01008":2,"01009":1,"01010":1,"01012":1,"01014":1,"01026":1,"01028":1,"01035":3,"01041":2,"01044":3,"01050":3,"02003":1,"02004":1,"02009":2,"02041":1,"02047":3,"02066":1,"02104":1,"03029":1,"03031":1,"03034":3,"03038":3,"03040":2,"03046":3,"04061":1,"04086":2}},{"id":7547,"name":"Secret Decoder Ring MK I","creation":"2014-07-10 21:39:04","description":"<p>The strategy behind this deck is to identify the key servers or data forts the corp is using.

It's a modified version of Chris's PE deck that won Cambridge reagonals. His version of the deck did not have enough money in it so I dropped the <a href=\"\/en\/card\/05011\">Shi.Ky\u016b<\/a> and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01071\">Zaibatsu Loyalty<\/a> for 3 medical research and changed around the ice a bit to make it more taxing. <a href=\"\/en\/card\/06003\">Lotus Field<\/a> is awesome to plug any serious holes, especially with a <a href=\"\/en\/card\/05017\">Komainu<\/a> on hq to keep siphons out. <a href=\"\/en\/card\/05017\">Komainu<\/a> is awesome to threaten flatlines with, if they face check it they cant proceed to check anything. If they do they will die even in the best case scenario of finding an agenda.<\/p>\n\n<p>To pilot the deck there are a few simple rules: <\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Always expect an account siphon, you have very little ice and it's pretty easy to get into archives unless you luck out and snipe the corresponding breaker to your HQ ice. You need to do your best to keep your credits above 9, that way you can take a siphon and keep <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01070\">Snare!<\/a>s active. It is even worth it to take a siphon on the chin early and not rez your ice just to keep your traps alive.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Do your best to never hit zero credits and preferably never go below 4. The moment you hit zero credits the shell game is over. It's safe to check everything, and if you are playing an experienced runner they will take full advantage of this. It is NEVER worth it to score an agenda on the table and break your self. Trust the shell game to keep your agenda safe while you get some credits. I often will drop a Gila hands keep it on the board for an extra turns to get my self over 7 credits(you still want to try to stay above 9, but it's hard against siphons) before I score it. <\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Try to score one pointers. If you get a <a href=\"\/en\/card\/03023\">Gila Hands Arcology<\/a> or a <a href=\"\/en\/card\/05004\">House of Knives<\/a> the game is a lot easier to win.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Always try to get a Ronin on the table with at least 3 advancement tokens on it. Ronin wins me 50% of my games. With one emp, you can drop them if they ever go down to 3 cards with only 2 credits. I find criminals will do this when they siphon you to two and think they are safe from triple emp. <\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Play everything(except <a href=\"\/en\/card\/05007\">The Future Perfect<\/a>). You cant get hung up about losing agendas or wondering if you should play a trap or an agenda. Just play everything as it comes up and the randomization of your deck will make it harder for the runner to pick out agendas. Sometimes they will be lucky and pick them out perfecty, sometimes you will flatline them on the first turn. It all comes down to luck.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Trust that the game is rigged. This deck is rather luck based, but I consider it like a casino. There are more traps than agendas, so you, as the house, have the advantage. Make sure the odds are stacked against them and you will win most of your games.<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Until people figure out how to play against PE kill decks, I think this will be a strong archetype. And it will be a fun and viable archetype after everyone figures it out. I'm super happy to see PE come finally come into it's own after wanting to play a solid kill deck since I started playing netrunner.<\/p>\n\n<p>Deck list and video of Chris's deck in action for the idea of how to play:\nhttp:\/\/stimhack.com\/regionals-cambridge-ma-2014-67-players\/<\/p>\n\n<p><em>Update<\/em> Took this to a store tournament and went undefeated as corp.

I hadn't really built decks on my own before, since I started playing Netrunner around the time that Honor and Profit came out. Now that I've started deckbuilding more frequently, I felt that it was finally time to make The Professor. <\/p>\n\n<p>Econ: \n<a href=\"\/en\/card\/03033\">Freelance Coding Contract<\/a> and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01044\">Magnum Opus<\/a> are the superstars of the deck.

Quality Time guarantees that I hit one relatively quick, then I can hold on to it for later.<\/p>\n\n<p>Programs: I've seen Professor builds in the past that didn't abuse his awesome ability.

How much does it take a runner whose worried about snares to break an  Komainu &amp; Wall of Thorns R&amp;D Server?  Or a Susano Chimera HQ?<\/p>\n\n<h2>ICE Mix<\/h2>\n\n<p>The Ice mix is based off of 2 different philosophies: <\/p>\n\n<h3>1. All Ice has TEETH<\/h3>\n\n<h3>2. ETR is a crutch (for Jinteki)<\/h3>\n\n<p>Chimera to frustrate a runner going after Assets, or a short term stop gap on R&amp;D or HQ. Wall of Thorns is perfect on R&amp;D, Komainu for HQ\/Archives and anywhere you think you can get it to land. Susan is amazing on a Remote to tax, especially with Komainu on Archives.<\/p>\n\n<h2>General Playstyle<\/h2>\n\n<p>Assets to tax the runner, but also make you money, Upgrades that let me 'Yank the money lever'. Do what it takes to rez that Hostile Infrastructure, it protects R&amp;D amazingly well.  Unlike Encryption Protocol (The early origin of this deck was DB0's Untrashable), it activates whenever a Whizzard player trashes your Jackson's from R&amp;D, and even hurts Shapers with a MOPUS in play.<\/p>\n\n<p>Basically I wind up building up an enormous economic advantage, and when I'm ready to start scoring, Ash, and some larger ICE lets me spend money to make it impossible for the runner to steal that agenda. Jackson and Interns make that economy come back over and over, and either the runner goes broke, or I'm Rich.  <\/p>\n\n<p>What I found that I was often able to sneak out a House of Knives (runner thinks its an Upgrade or just another asset or bluff an agenda as a trap. Inazuma\/Komainu\/HOK combo actually wound up happening much more than you might think, as did a well timed Shinobi (with tons of cash).  Scoring a HOK that way can be brutal, now when I install an Ash, or anything else, the runner feels compelled to at least check it ... if its a second HOK they can be in a real tough spot.<\/p>\n\n<p>Shocks are hilarious when someone digs around Archives only to find NAPDs or Future Perfects.  It's also great to draw up so you can discard them ... make the runner think you're desperate (Click for a card .... click for a card ... sigh, click for a card), discard your shocks, and they Legwork, only to find 1 point and a bunch of celebrity gifts.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n\n<p>I tend to Celebrity Gift hands most people think aren't ideal, but this deck needs to be played with a fair amount of aggression and boldness.  This is not a deck for a player who likes to create a giant stack of ICE and feels safe at every moment, in fact I'd say its for the Netrunner version of an Adrenaline Junkie.  The deck with a lot of pilot skill can win quite often, I'm probably at 75-80% win rate if not a little higher, and is a lot of fun to play, and I think play against.\nIt was a really fun deck, but its time to evolve onto the NEXT thing.

Tennin's greatest strength, in my opinion, is that it puts a lot of pressure on the runner to make those successful runs. The best way to capitalize on that is to tax them. The more effort the runner puts into hitting your servers, the less they can focus on developing their rig. Let them in, but make them pay. They'll need turns to refuel, and that's when you'll get your Tennin tokens. Ice everything. Shock in archives is useless when the runner plops down Security Testing, so we've taken those out for more econ.<\/p>\n\n<p>Ice Wall. Let it get big. Let it get silly. Odds are, they only have one Femme, and you have three ice walls, so even if they make one wall cheap to break, they can't do it for all of them. Advance it. Seriously. This thing is going to be sticking around for a while. It basically can't be parasited. It can't be Atman'd. If you treat it right, it can't even be knight'd reliably. Beast.<\/p>\n\n<p>Architect. Ice destruction is brutal for this deck. Architect is a really nice bit of ice recursion for you, and if they just so happen to be running last click, pull out a Braintrust and score it next turn.<\/p>\n\n<p>Lag Time. Goddamn is this thing good with Lotus Field. So many decks rely on a 4str Atman to break Lotus Field, so Lag Time turns it into a brutally impenetrable wall. Also just really good to increase the tax your servers are going to cause.<\/p>\n\n<p>Medical Research Fundraiser. I know, you don't like to give the runner money. Listen, you'll be taking it away. When all your econ has to come from operations, your choices become limited. Anyway, this card is surprisingly good.

The basic idea is to see the Runners hand, and get counters on Snoop. Once they've got only events &amp; resources, you Invade their privacy, and either Neural EMP or Snoop token them to death. No Plascrete protection. This decks worst enemy, as far as I can tell, is increased hand size, and The Professor :P<\/p>\n\n<p>SanSan is still included in the case of decks that are unable to be killed in this way, I might still be able to set up a scoring server and build the astrotrain.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Reversed Accounts<\/strong>: I don't have any tagging, so I don't have closed accounts. Making the runner lose all their money makes Invasion of Privacy easier to pull off. I can set up a 'scoring' server with a Snoop, and IAA the reversed accounts. If they get through, no biggie, they either gave me a counter on Snoop or spent the resources to get through my Snoop and whatever other Ice I have there. If they don't run it, they lose at least 8c, or more if I advance a bit more before popping it. It depends on the situation, especially since Invasion of Privacy is a double.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Economy:<\/strong> It seems to me like this deck needs a pretty good economy. Say the runner has 4 event\/resources in hand, and one hardware. I'd need to land an Invasion of Privacy, beating their trace by 4, and hit them with a Neural EMP and a Snoop counter to flatline them. My economy cards are Hedge Fund, Sweeps Week, Pop-up, Caduceus, and Private Contracts. Hedge Fund, Sweeps Week, and Pop-up are no brainers. Caduceus in Making News can double as both an economy card, if they can't get a Mimic out soon enough, and an ETR ice (otherwise its a nice little bit of tax). I'm a little worried rezzing this too early could force a sentry breaker to break my Snoops, but we'll see. Last is Private Contracts. It can be a fake out for an Astroscript install to be triple advanced next turn. It might get the runner to take a Snoop token, only to see it's 5c to trash. Overall though, I wanted more economy than what I had since the combo requires quite a bit. I might swap this out for Melange, but I wanted something with a higher trash cost since they will be really inclined to running it (plus Melange thins out your R&amp;D if they trash from there).<\/p>\n\n<p>Another weird include I threw in was Sagittarius.

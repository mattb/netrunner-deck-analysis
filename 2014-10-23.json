(and to sweep several local store champs with as well.)<\/p>\n\n<p>This list is hyper-optimized to beat NBN. The rig has very few moving parts, which frees up a bunch of slots to run a whopping 14 dedicated economy cards (17 if you count siphon). There's no special trick like scrubber to make trashing sansans easier; you just pay for it out of pocket, use mr. li to find more money, keep running, and eventually close out the game with keyhole. I've found that, as long as you're able to keep jackson off the table, keyhole is consistently able to race the astrotrain.<\/p>\n\n<p>With the advent of Blue Sun, runners are stretched thinner than ever, needing to combat both astrobiotics and big-ice glacier. I believe Mr. Li will be a mandatory 3-of for criminals in the upcoming meta. Against NBN, he lets you set up your rig extremely quickly and then ensures you draw nothing but sure gambles into the mid- and end-game. Against Weyland he lets you find your 1-of silver bullets so you can play more of a controlling role.<\/p>\n\n<p>The flex slots are the 1 emergency shutdown, the 1 plascrete, the 2nd copy of bank job, the 2nd lucky find, the 3rd daily casts, and maaaaaaybe the 3rd special order. I'd slot 1 parasite instead of a lucky find when I'm afraid of HB\/RP glacier, and maybe also pack a security testing (but I wouldn't want those against blue sun). However, under no circumstances should you cut the 2nd corroder.<\/p>\n\n<p>In the past I've tried PPVP, hostage, 1-of professional contacts (back during H&amp;P when RP was big), and even logos (it was originally based on an Iain deck). But running desperados, pure money cards, and 3 mr. li is way better.<\/p>\n\n<p>The deck is weak to eli 1.0 on R&amp;D, double eli 1.0 on R&amp;D, NEXT silver builds, hard ETR sentries (especially tsurugi), and power shutdown. RP glacier is a bad matchup; you have to keep them off-balance in the early game or things will slip out of control.<\/p>\n\n<p>Playing the deck against NBN, I almost never kill their economy assets, don't kill face-down sansan unless I feel like I'm behind, and have to strategically plan ahead to ensure that jackson isn't on the board, and elis are placed elsewhere, by the time keyhole appears.<\/p>\n\n<p>Incidentally, this deck also eats cambridge jinteki for breakfast, where a normal R&amp;D interface build would fail. :P<\/p>\n","username":"bblum","cards":{"01007":2,"01018":3,"01022":3,"01024":3,"01026":1,"01029":2,"01050":3,"02007":1,"02009":1,"02043":1,"02083":1,"02087":2,"02091":1,"02104":2,"02105":3,"03052":3,"03053":3,"03054":3,"04061":1,"04109":2,"05035":3,"05041":1,"05046":1}},{"id":10090,"name":"Scorched by the Blue Sun v1.1","creation":"2014-10-23 07:24:09","description":"<p>Trying out <a href=\"\/en\/card\/06008\">The Root<\/a> and a full set of <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01070\">Snare!<\/a>, which can be an even better deterrent when you res and installed one and bring it back to your hand.

Even just getting an Agenda in the first turns, and removing some ice from HQ or R&amp;D can be very troublesome for the Corp, and definitely helps in keeping up the pressure.<\/p>\n\n<p>To try and get an Agenda as soon as possible you need multi-access, because sheer luck might work some times, but a <a href=\"\/en\/card\/05035\">Legwork<\/a> can be dramatic against a Corp that has 1 or 2 Agenda in HQ from the start. <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02106\">Indexing<\/a> is one of my favourite cards, and I use it most of the times over <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01036\">TME<\/a> because it poses no danger against Jinteki, but the added value of seeing what they will get and place it in the preferred order helps with the general idea of slowing down the Corp while we accelerate the pace of the game.<\/p>\n\n<p>I tried going with <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02085\">HQ Interface<\/a> and\/or <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02107\">R&amp;D Interface<\/a> because they work with <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01021\">Inside Job<\/a> and don't fear <a href=\"\/en\/card\/06048\">Crisium Grid<\/a>, but they are too expensive in early game and overall too slow for Leela.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"\/en\/card\/02090\">Kraken<\/a> was another card I used with some success, but it's too situational, meaning you need to have a decent target, get an Agenda before the last Click and keep 3 credits to use it. Not happening so often.<\/p>\n\n<p>Economy wise the deck is quite light, but the Programs I chose in the end are also quite efficient and inexpensive:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"\/en\/card\/06096\">Cerberus \"Rex\" H2<\/a> avoided me wasting influence for some Shaper Decoder, and works very nicely. After all not every Code Gate needs breaking and they hardly have more than 2 subroutines anyway. Plus for some you can use Clicks.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"\/en\/card\/01007\">Corroder<\/a> alternatives were either too frail or too expensive. Too use or to install.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"\/en\/card\/02104\">Faerie<\/a> can break even the best for few creds, and it doesn't even cost a dime to install. Nothing beats it, economy-wise not even the new Anarch dog.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"\/en\/card\/02065\">Crescentus<\/a> warns the Corp: do you really wanna spend a lot, knowing I will break and derez? So just install one and watch them ponder every rez.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"\/en\/card\/05045\">Grappling Hook<\/a> helps a lot against the big guys and can be useful against unusual targets as well (you don't need to break every subroutine on <a href=\"\/en\/card\/05016\">Inazuma<\/a> anyway). So it can be used in place of a Faerie or a Cerberus' counter.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Of course there's a notable absence of <em>permanent<\/em> Icebreakers in the deck, but that's the reason behind the name Burning Bridges. There's no turning back here, either you win fast, or you'll end up struggling, because late game ain't no friend of yours.<\/p>\n\n<p>Let's be honest here, I also wanted to create a different deck, not the usual cards you see in every Criminal. I had to go with <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01024\">Desperado<\/a> as a console, in the end, because the others just didn't fit right. <a href=\"\/en\/card\/06079\">Astrolabe<\/a> could have been wonderful, but there's only so many corps that go horizontal after all. And <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02064\">Doppelg\u00e4nger<\/a> or <a href=\"\/en\/card\/06055\">BOX-E<\/a> didn't add anything significant.<\/p>\n\n<p>No <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02009\">Plascrete Carapace<\/a> either. Why? Because most of the Tag n Bag decks that I've seen recently go with <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01086\">SEA Source<\/a>, so <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01032\">Decoy<\/a> is a better option (cheaper) and helps defending <a href=\"\/en\/card\/06097\">Zona Sul Shipping<\/a> too. This new economy card is quite good, especially with multiple copies installed.<\/p>\n\n<p>The rest of the economy is made by <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01019\">Easy Mark<\/a>(better than <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01050\">Sure Gamble<\/a> here, since you don't need credits to use it), <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02091\">Kati Jones<\/a> and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01053\">Armitage Codebusting<\/a>, which is the poor's <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01044\">Magnum Opus<\/a> basically. But it's cheap to install and provides enough. I initially went with <a href=\"\/en\/card\/05050\">Tri-maf Contact<\/a>, but when I removed the <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02009\">Plascrete<\/a> I had to remove that too.<\/p>\n\n<p>Last but not least, <a href=\"\/en\/card\/06100\">Utopia Shard<\/a> which can be a very nice option for Leela. If you get some cards back to their HQ, you can use this right after and maybe discard them. Not too shabby for the last influence point available.<\/p>\n\n<p>There's a lot more cards that might be useful for Leela, like <a href=\"\/en\/card\/05039\">Unregistered S&amp;W '35<\/a> for example. If they see you could get their Caprice back to their HQ, the corp might rez it on her own... and then you would need just that Hardware to kill it.<\/p>\n\n<p>But unfortunately deck space is what it is and it's not a good idea to go over 45 cards with no extra draw whatsoever.<\/p>\n","username":"paddosan","cards":{"01007":2,"01019":3,"01021":3,"01022":3,"01024":2,"01032":3,"01053":3,"02043":2,"02065":3,"02091":2,"02104":3,"02106":2,"03038":2,"05035":3,"05045":2,"06095":1,"06096":3,"06097":3,"06100":1}},{"id":10094,"name":"Prepaid Andy","creation":"2014-10-23 10:20:46","description":"\n","username":"Kroen","cards":{"01007":2,"01018":3,"01019":2,"01021":2,"01022":3,"01024":3,"01026":1,"01036":1,"01050":3,"02007":2,"02083":1,"02087":1,"02104":3,"03052":3,"03054":3,"04029":3,"04109":2,"05033":3,"05035":3,"05036":1,"06036":1}},{"id":10095,"name":"My anaconda don't want none unless you got PUNS SUN","creation":"2014-10-23 11:39:54","description":"\n","username":"CodeMarvelous","cards":{"01090":3,"01102":3,"01106":2,"01110":3,"02018":3,"02019":3,"02079":3,"02120":1,"03027":2,"04015":3,"04038":3,"04040":3,"04060":2,"04077":2,"04078":2,"04099":2,"04117":1,"06003":2,"06030":1,"06048":3,"06068":1,"06069":1,"06071":1}},{"id":10097,"name":"DELETE","creation":"2014-10-23 13:41:54","description":"<p>In honour of Kit Peddler's namesake (http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Kit_Pedler)  the creator of Doctor Who's Cybermen: DELETE.<\/p>\n","username":"paulxthompson","cards":{"01012":3,"01026":1,"01041":1,"01044":2,"01050":3,"02009":2,"02047":2,"02049":2,"02065":3,"02066":2,"02088":2,"02090":1,"02107":2,"03028":1,"03038":2,"03046":2,"03049":2,"04006":3,"04007":2,"04086":2,"04108":1,"06040":2,"06057":2,"06079":1}},{"id":10098,"name":"Painting on a Sneaky Dinosaur","creation":"2014-10-23 14:33:45","description":"<p>The strategy is to play the early game running as much as possible. <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01014\">Yog.0<\/a> ASAP, don't worry about <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02048\">Dinosaurus<\/a>.

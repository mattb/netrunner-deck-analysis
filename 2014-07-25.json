Its basically another deck with a lot of taxing ice. But it has some \"twists\". <\/p>\n\n<p>How to play \"The Next Frustration\":<\/p>\n\n<p>So what you are basically doing is securing your remotes ASAP. This makes sure, that you will be able to play your <a href=\"\/en\/card\/03014\">Successful Demonstration<\/a>. Dont mind playing any of your assets in a remote, except maybe a <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01070\">Snare!<\/a>. You could also protect it with a <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02015\">Snowflake<\/a> to generate more money when they run on it. Whatever it is, it might cost the runner either cards, money or both (to remove the tag). If you face a Runner, where you might fear an account siphon , secure your HQ with a <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04114\">Caprice Nisei<\/a> if possible. <\/p>\n\n<p>By the way, if you go for any a psi game, dont hesitate to pay two credits. This will make the runner think that you have something valuable there. Always take time to think about your psi games. This confuses many runners. Never go for the: I dont care, ill just go for 0 credits, then ill still get 1 credit. Just go for that if you really need that 1 credit next turn. Dont forget: Every psi game above 0 credits also costs the runner and might also make it impossible for him to steal that <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04119\">NAPD Contract<\/a>. <\/p>\n\n<p>Now some \"In Depth\":<\/p>\n\n<p>Agendas: <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04119\">NAPD Contract<\/a> and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/05007\">The Future Perfect<\/a> can be really taxing and its uncertain if they will be able to steal it. <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01068\">Nisei MK II<\/a> is good to make it possible to finally score one <a href=\"\/en\/card\/05007\">The Future Perfect<\/a>. Also it can keep your valuable <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04114\">Caprice Nisei<\/a> alive if you finally loose that psi game. <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02032\">Fetal AI<\/a> is there for the \"Komaino -> Fetal -> Dead\" Run.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Assets: \nI guess one <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01070\">Snare!<\/a> and two <a href=\"\/en\/card\/05010\">Psychic Field<\/a> are enough to protect your <a href=\"\/en\/card\/05009\">Mental Health Clinic<\/a> and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01108\">Melange Mining Corp.<\/a> at least for one turn. <a href=\"\/en\/card\/05009\">Mental Health Clinic<\/a> maybe just does not work perfect in combination with <a href=\"\/en\/card\/05013\">Cerebral Cast<\/a> and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01099\">Scorched Earth<\/a> but at least they wont expect it. <\/p>\n\n<p>Operations: Economy and \"the Twist\". Do not care about them playing a plascrete. <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01084\">Closed Accounts<\/a> is still a possibility. In the end even brain damage is nice. Maybe overwrite your <a href=\"\/en\/card\/05009\">Mental Health Clinic<\/a> then. <\/p>\n\n<p>Ice: I guess most of the ice is pretty self-explanatory except maybe the <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02073\">Bullfrog<\/a> and the <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01062\">Ichi 1.0<\/a>. <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02073\">Bullfrog<\/a> is a really nice card in the begining to protect a central server against any run events. After that it might help to protect an asset, the archives or even every server, cause is becoming even more taxing. <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01062\">Ichi 1.0<\/a> is the only way to trash programms. Also it has that nice trace that fits to our \"twist\". Nice ice for centrals.<\/p>\n\n<p>Thats it so far. Have some good experience with this deck so far. Still looking for some minor tweaks.

Criminal has all the tools to build a great anarchy denial deck and then some.  Silhouette has a much greater chance of getting a Siphon in hand early, which has been a problem for my various Reina decks.  And if SIl doesn't get the Siphon she can just play a money event and get that HQ lock in prep for it..  Reina has to waste a turn on Armitage.<\/p>\n\n<p>Silhouette needs to make successful runs when she wants to.  Those runs need to do bad things to the corp and make it easier to make more successful runs. Bursty econ, Overmind, and criminal events are the clear choice for these goals.  <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04029\">Prepaid VoicePAD<\/a> is a slight tempo hit- takes two events before it's paid for itself plus the click to install.  But getting it out early gives this deck staying power.  Half of the cards in the deck can use that credit.  Against a taxing deck you'll Levy or SOT a Levy and get your supercharged econ right back in the deck.<\/p>\n\n<p>Ideal starting hand has <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01050\">Sure Gamble<\/a>, <a href=\"\/en\/card\/05053\">Overmind<\/a>, and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01018\">Account Siphon<\/a>.

FAO acts like an instant parasite as soon as their creds are low. You know <em>what<\/em> to parasite because you're running HQ all the time.  HQ lock also lets you know when to run a remote.  Siphon is strong as always.  <\/p>\n\n<p>I tried <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04085\">Blackguard<\/a> + <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02045\">Snitch<\/a> but found that FAO was just so much stronger.  Adding in a Levy lets you do up to 6 FAO\/Shutdowns (not including SOTs).  You can do them early game, where they help you most, as opposed to Blackguard's late game activation, when the corp may have rezzed everything anyways.<\/p>\n\n<p>I'm excited to try this in a tournament setting.

The few times it's been an issue is when the main solution (in this version Professional Contacts) doesn't appear soon. Previous versions of this deck used the Oracle May-Motivation combo, but waiting for Motivation to show up as opposed to Hostage-ing for ProCo potentially killed off the bonus money from the combo.<\/p>\n\n<p>Other strategies to note:\n-Saving your Fall Guys for keeping The Source from Trashing (and remembering that you need 3 more credits to steal, when you start calculating run costs!)\n-If you get the Compromised Employee's out early, purposefully face-checking all their ice. Assuming the corp isn't rich, the odds of it being a nasty sub is low, and they either won't rez, or they're taxed, and you get some money while bouncing off.\n-Hold off of putting Crypsis out as long as you can, so the corp doesn't think you have a remote solution\n-Save your Same Old Things for Calling in Favors (I regularly pull in ~10 credits on CiF by mid-game) and, in a pinch, Inside Job. Account Siphon may actually leave this deck soon, as 80% of the time I have so much money that it's not worth it.\n-Iain's ability can work as an implicit bluff if your opponent realizes that you're purposefully not running until they score; They may start installing a ton of lightly protected agendas (and traps), advancing them to one below scoring.

I leave them unprotected; if the runner really wants to spend a Click and 3+ bucks to trash it, fine by me.  <\/p>\n\n<p>But overall, Asset economy, like any HB deck, will be the bread and butter; Guarding The Net is awesome for getting that early protection.  A particularly horrid opening was Mother Goddess protecting Melange after turn 1.  Delicious.<\/p>\n\n<p>Overall, the early start helps you (a) Set up \"scoring windows\" and squeak out a turn 2 or 3 Agenda while the runner is still getting their stuff together and (b) Turtle up with a Melange or use other means of getting a nice cash start.<\/p>\n\n<p>OTHER TIDBITS:<\/p>\n\n<p>I threw a Jackson in there (because he's Jackson).  I only used 3 Influence (not much I really wanted to spend it on, but I'm sure I'll dabble in some different, influence heavy ICE) so I figured a Jackson never hurts, though to be honest, with all the ICE that gets placed over Archives, I haven't really needed Jackson.<\/p>\n\n<p>Some Successful Demonstrations are great early on (when the runner is face checking your ETR ICE), but you can get unlucky if you get them later on and they sit in your hand since the Runner probably won't make an unsuccessful run ever again.  Not sure if these are keepers or not.<\/p>\n\n<p>Anyways, that's the gist.  So far the deck has worked pretty well.<\/p>\n","username":"BreadRising","cards":{"01055":3,"01056":2,"01061":2,"01062":2,"01108":2,"01110":3,"02013":2,"02029":2,"02051":3,"02056":2,"02092":3,"02110":3,"03003":1,"03006":1,"03014":2,"03015":2,"03019":3,"03023":1,"04011":3,"04015":1,"04119":2,"06002":3,"06010":2}},{"id":7922,"name":"Post-Modernist Destruction","creation":"2014-07-25 22:19:33","description":"\n","username":"CodeMarvelous","cards":{"01064":2,"01093":1,"01094":3,"01098":3,"01099":3,"01101":2,"01103":3,"01110":3,"02018":3,"02070":3,"02116":1,"03026":3,"04015":3,"04017":3,"04036":1,"04040":2,"04119":1,"06003":3,"06009":2,"06010":2,"06012":3}},{"id":7923,"name":"NEXT Stop Earth","creation":"2014-07-25 22:54:19","description":"\n","username":"smartblue","cards":{"01082":3,"01084":2,"01088":3,"01109":3,"01110":3,"02016":1,"02034":1,"02055":3,"02056":3,"04011":3,"04015":2,"04033":1,"04055":2,"04075":2,"04095":3,"04119":3,"05018":2,"06002":3,"06003":1,"06005":1,"06007":3,"06012":2}},{"id":7924,"name":"Jinteki Honor","creation":"2014-07-25 22:54:44","description":"\n","username":"GreatDantone","cards":{"01067":1,"01069":2,"01070":3,"01078":1,"01084":1,"01086":1,"01099":2,"01110":2,"02032":3,"02112":2,"03009":1,"04012":3,"04013":2,"04015":2,"04033":1,"04074":1,"04093":2,"05004":3,"05006":1,"05007":3,"05013":3,"05014":2,"05015":3,"05016":1,"05017":2,"05019":2}},{"id":7925,"name":"Fassetrobiotics","creation":"2014-07-25 23:41:35","description":"\n","username":"arribous","cards":{"01059":3,"01081":3,"01082":2,"01090":2,"01092":3,"01109":3,"01110":3,"01111":2,"02029":2,"02055":3,"02056":3,"02060":2,"02110":3,"02115":3,"04015":3,"04096":2,"04119":3,"05024":2,"05027":2,"06005":1}}]

I haven't played much since, but the few times I've played with friends lately it's still stood strong.<\/p>\n\n<p>The core aim of this deck is this: Get exactly what you need, exactly when you need it.

Run those runners ragged trying to hit your remotes and giving them minimum time to build their rig.<\/p>\n\n<p>Agendas:\nMostly standard stuff. False leads can lead to Nisei's and both add to the runner's frustration. Priority Req for the few piece of moderately expensive ice we have.<\/p>\n\n<p>Assets:<\/p>\n\n<p>Lots of economic assets. Sundews are obviously one of the strongest and you'll want to protect with at least a simple ETR. PADs can be left naked since they're costly to trash. The aggressive secretary is a nice surprise for when you can get the game to match point. I didn't say I totally disregarded the bluff game :)<\/p>\n\n<p>Upgrade:<\/p>\n\n<p>Corporate troubleshooters are nice for making ice on your centrals stick. This deck generally has pretty solid economy so you'll be able to pump a piece of ice at a crucial point.<\/p>\n\n<p>Operations:\nCelebrity gift is good for econ obviously and since we're not really playing the bluff game the knowledge to the runner is slightly less valuable.<\/p>\n\n<p>Interns are also great in this deck. Nothing like having runners exhaust themselves trying to hit that Sundew only to install it the very next turn.<\/p>\n\n<p>Ice:<\/p>\n\n<p>A decent mix of cheap ETRs, some mid range taxing ice, and some slightly more expensive hitters.<\/p>\n\n<p>The general rule of thumb is to put the cheap ETRs on your Sundew\/Agenda server and your stronger ETR and taxing ice on centrals. <\/p>\n\n<p>Ichi 1.0 and Uroboros fill kinda the same role (leaky, but heavily taxing ice) and can be swapped for another copy of each other depending on preference. Tsurugi also fills this niche, but can't really be replaced.<\/p>\n\n<p>Swordsman is a cheaper taxer and can be your ace against AI breakers.<\/p>\n\n<p>The single Enigma is good to have early when the Yog isn't out and also serves to tax the runner so they can't run your remotes.<\/p>\n\n<p>Potential Changes:<\/p>\n\n<p>Celebrity Gift and Melange fill very similar roles and can be swapped for each other depending on preference.<\/p>\n\n<p>Tsurugis can be dropped if AIs aren't a huge threat. More cheap ETRs would go in their place (perhaps datapikes or drop the Ichi 1.0\/Uro for Rotos).<\/p>\n\n<p>Many thanks to the contributors of this Reddit Thread: http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Netrunner\/comments\/1ygokr\/nonbluffing_jinteki\/<\/p>\n","username":"vevicus","cards":{"01057":1,"01062":1,"01065":2,"01068":3,"01078":2,"01090":2,"01106":2,"01108":2,"01109":3,"01110":3,"01111":1,"01113":3,"02014":3,"02031":1,"02074":1,"02080":2,"04012":2,"04013":3,"04015":3,"04033":2,"04054":3,"04060":3,"04074":2}},{"id":2435,"name":"andy is a bitch","creation":"2014-02-20 22:01:30","description":"<p>Yup<\/p>\n","username":"Milchtee","cards":{"01007":2,"01008":3,"01011":1,"01014":2,"01018":3,"01019":3,"01020":1,"01021":3,"01022":3,"01024":2,"01026":1,"01027":1,"01030":1,"01034":1,"01050":3,"01053":1,"02009":1,"02043":3,"02083":1,"02091":1,"02104":3,"02106":1,"03052":3,"03054":2}},{"id":2436,"name":"Test","creation":"2014-02-20 22:15:08","description":"<p>Midpsycho<\/p>\n","username":"Milchtee","cards":{"01062":2,"01080":1,"01081":3,"01082":2,"01084":2,"01085":2,"01088":2,"01090":1,"01092":3,"01108":2,"01110":3,"01111":2,"02040":1,"02056":2,"02097":2,"02110":2,"02115":3,"02116":2,"03026":1,"04012":3,"04014":3,"04015":3,"04076":3}}]

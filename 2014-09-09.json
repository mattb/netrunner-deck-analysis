Your basic game plan is to plant a sundew firmly behind willo or caprice and some solid ice, try to score a Gila's hands early as well.  Then leverage that strong economy to build up your defences and use willo and caprice to create scoring windows.  With the 3 for 2 agendas and the Thomas Haas you want to step up the tempo a little bit from a glacier RP build and try to keep an advancing rhythm going.  Then clip off a breaker with the willo or one of the killers when they overreach.  <\/p>\n\n<p>The economy might look a little light, but this is an evolution from having more that wasn't getting used.  Often one well protected sundew or a Gila's hands is all you will need.<\/p>\n\n<p>All of the ice is intended to force out both a breaker and a break every time to enable your willos.  Neural katana was selected over komainu or Tsurugi for that reason, since it can't be run through like komainu, is a bit cheaper than Tsurugi, and though it isn't taxing, when combined with willo it can still knock out the runners killer. <\/p>\n\n<p>Targeted Marketing works great sometimes but can also be a bit fragile if you play it early since you can be vulnerable to early R&amp;D accesses hitting an agenda and knocking it out.<\/p>\n\n<p>I think there can be lots of variation in how you build and play this, the willo, sundew, and etr + destroyer ice is the basic recipe.<\/p>\n","username":"Garbo","cards":{"01064":2,"01077":3,"01090":3,"01110":3,"01111":3,"01113":1,"02014":3,"02031":1,"03012":2,"03023":3,"04013":2,"04015":3,"04020":1,"04054":3,"04060":2,"04114":3,"05006":1,"05007":3,"06003":3,"06026":2,"06032":3}},{"id":9382,"name":"Astro-bluff-otics (Hint: it's not Astrobiotics)","creation":"2014-09-09 01:19:20","description":"<p>It's an Astrobiotics deck, until it's not.

This is Dien from ANRTheFallGuys. I decided to post up a updated version of my 3 time Store Champ winning deck with some overhaul work for the current meta. I recently took this to a local tournament which had 20 players, and it ended up going undefeated 5-0. I had been matched up with Gabe, Prepaid Kate, 2 Chaos Theory's with Levy, and a Noise, and it scored off agenda points with scoring windows created off my upgrades. Let's get into specifics!<\/p>\n\n<p>The deck has several synergies to itself. I purposely picked Chimera for on demand Will-O-The-Wisp targetting. With this play, if you have Targetted Marketting, you can safely call a necessary breaker they need to complete their rig. I had called out Corroder and Femme Fatale and netted an average of 20 credits during games. This plays into the next play: Corporate Troubleshooter.<\/p>\n\n<p>A server with Corporate Troubleshooter and a Grim\/Archer guarantees a snipe of a breaker. Knowing they'll play a necessary breaker to give you 10 helps you fortify the server.<\/p>\n\n<p>Targeted Marketing I find is a advanced card. To play this effectively, you'll need to understand the various archetypes and their timings. You need to know cornerstone cards to play, I made in the late game, a call on The Maker's Eye since I hadn't seen it played past the first 20 cards the Runner had played as Kate, and I knew it was coming. The call netted me 20 free credits, helped burn a bunch of Clone Chips and Test Runs for Sharpshooter VS Archer, and netted the Runner nothing due to the fact I had most agendas in hand.<\/p>\n\n<p>I love that Corporate Troubleshooter and Will-O-The-Wisp work with each other very well. Feinting each other and keeping the Runner guessing messes with their math\/options, so it's great to have with each other. They also feint as Agendas, and can set up for brutal plays.<\/p>\n\n<p>I put in The Root and it kicked bottom. I usually set up one server with big ICE, another with one Archer\/ETR and a Will. On my turn, I install agenda\/CT\/Will, The Root in the other, rez it and advance the agenda or ICE another layer on the big remote with Root money. This forces the Runner into a fork and guarantees either that the Root stays up, or it goes away, I get a economy swing because of the run, and a breaker goes to the bottom.<\/p>\n\n<p>This deck swims in Bad Pubilicity, I had won Store Championships with 7 Bad Pub, and I won at the local tournament recently with 5. You need to understand that Bad Pub is not always bad, as long as they don't have the breakers to get in. I'm still working on tinkering with the ICE suite, I feel I can optimize it better, but for now it stood the test of Runners, and I'm pretty confident with it. Any feedback is welcome, and if you have any questions, feel free to ask!<\/p>\n","username":"d1en","cards":{"01057":1,"01062":1,"01065":3,"01090":1,"01093":1,"01094":3,"01098":2,"01101":3,"01103":2,"01106":3,"01110":3,"01111":3,"02018":3,"02060":2,"02070":1,"04015":3,"04017":1,"04020":3,"04040":2,"04117":2,"06008":2,"06026":2,"06032":3}},{"id":9411,"name":"Skrubbed v.1.5","creation":"2014-09-09 16:48:09","description":"\n","username":"jeremyorion","cards":{"01014":1,"01034":3,"01036":2,"01037":2,"01040":2,"01043":1,"01046":1,"01050":3,"02027":1,"02047":3,"02050":2,"02063":1,"02091":2,"02107":2,"03028":1,"03034":2,"03044":3,"03045":1,"03046":2,"03052":3,"03054":2,"05035":1,"06018":2,"06034":3}},{"id":9412,"name":"Dec@Day.09 - The Most Dangerous Game","creation":"2014-09-09 16:52:30","description":"<p><em><strong>Dec@Day<\/strong> - Every identity, one day and deck at a time.

So really, it's all about diverting attention from where you're really planning to make a big run.<\/p>\n\n<p>Phase 3: Go hard or go home<\/p>\n\n<p>The late game (if you haven't won by now) will typically have very well defended servers and a corp beginning to turn the economy tide in their favour. As soon as they are on 5 points and threatening to score for the win, that is when I will start keeping tags, mass installing viruses and stimhacking servers like a mad man. Sometimes it's stimhacking a remote for the agenda, sometimes it's stimhacking for one last Medium dig, sometimes its installing multiple viruses then hitting archives. The most important thing to be able to do is to work out which server is most agenda-dense. That is the number one skill to have when playing Noise.<\/p>\n\n<p>Also, realise that if you are not milling agendas then the only place for them to go is HQ and all their ice and economy has just been milled into archives, making it even harder to defend their agendas in HQ.<\/p>\n","username":"Leviathan","cards":{"01001":1,"01002":2,"01004":2,"01006":1,"01008":2,"01010":2,"01012":3,"01050":3,"01051":3,"01053":2,"02003":3,"02022":3,"02091":2,"03038":3,"03052":3,"04043":3,"04109":2,"05033":3,"05035":1,"06034":2}},{"id":9425,"name":"The Rainbow Bridge","creation":"2014-09-09 23:53:41","description":"<p>An advantage of skipping out on most of the ice game is that you bank money fast. This means you can biotic agendas easily, and what ice you do have can be pretty significant. For this reason I\u2019m running three <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01061\">Heimdall 1.0<\/a>, a <a href=\"\/en\/card\/03015\">Heimdall 2.0<\/a>, and one <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01062\">Ichi 1.0<\/a> as my only ice. They can singlehandedly make a server frustrating to get into and, while vulnerable to being shutdown, that\u2019s not as much of an issue here as elsewhere given the sheer amount of money you can generate. The low number of them doesn't matter so much using <a href=\"\/en\/card\/06021\">The Foundry: Refining the Process<\/a>. They can snowball into HQ fairly quickly.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"\/en\/card\/01056\">Adonis Campaign<\/a>, <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02092\">Eve Campaign<\/a>, <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01109\">PAD Campaign<\/a> and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04015\">Jackson Howard<\/a> provide the economic core of the deck. Installing these basics on a <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02095\">Hokusai Grid<\/a> only makes them more of a positive trade for you. Runners have to choose to leave either Hokusai or whatever was on it standing, a big win either way. A secondary set of economic tools are <a href=\"\/en\/card\/03008\">Alix T4LB07<\/a> and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01060\">Shipment from MirrorMorph<\/a>. Neither are fantastic on their own, but together they let you run a turn where you install and rez Alix, shipment three cards and then use Alix, for three installs and 5 net credits in one turn.<\/p>\n\n<p>To frustrate the runner, <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01070\">Snare!<\/a> and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/03009\">Cerebral Overwriter<\/a> provide some unexpected annoyance and force them to be careful about just running everything all the time. <a href=\"\/en\/card\/06022\">Enhanced Login Protocol<\/a> is another frustration for the runner and can counter other currents the runner might use. <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04050\">Isabel McGuire<\/a> is a great card that let you pull a lot of unexpected plays. <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04050\">Isabel McGuire<\/a> can click your almost-finished campaigns back to hand as well as the aforementioned <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01070\">Snare!<\/a> the runner has been foolish enough not to trash.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"\/en\/card\/01059\">Biotic Labor<\/a> and a hard-to-read agenda suite of <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01055\">Accelerated Beta Test<\/a>, <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02051\">Project Vitruvius<\/a> and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/03023\">Gila Hands Arcology<\/a> provide dual ways of scoring out. Bluffing on the ground and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01059\">Biotic Labor<\/a> to clear the hand if the runner is spending all their time checking your remotes. <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04119\">NAPD Contract<\/a> can be scored with a bit of both, in a pinch, or be placed behind a Heimdall to tax hard.<\/p>\n\n<p>Finally, since you\u2019re going to be running through your deck fast and probably seeing sets of all three of a card here and there, a <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04111\">Reclamation Order<\/a> lets you get them back. Since these cards are somewhat situational, playing multiples that can clog up your hand is not the best idea. Despite their power, I\u2019m keeping the count low.  <\/p>\n\n<p>How to play the deck<\/p>\n\n<p>The most important thing to learn playing this deck is reading your opponent and controlling your own tells. You are going to put down unprotected agendas every game, so making sure that <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01055\">Accelerated Beta Test<\/a> looks like just another <a href=\"\/en\/card\/03009\">Cerebral Overwriter<\/a> is pretty important. That kind of bluff is important, but you can also do the five-card-install turn (<a href=\"\/en\/card\/01060\">Shipment from MirrorMorph<\/a> and two more) and use your <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01070\">Snare!<\/a> and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/03009\">Cerebral Overwriter<\/a> to create windows of fear. Sometimes this does necessitate balls of steel.<\/p>\n\n<p>Keep drawing through your deck and installing at least one, preferably two cards per turn under normal circumstances. Put heimdalls down as you get them. First priority is R&amp;D because a lock can really mess you up, though if you suspect siphon recursion, protecting HQ can be pretty important too once you start banking lots of credits. If you\u2019re low you can just rez a bunch of the random cards you\u2019ve installed to blank the siphon.<\/p>\n\n<p>Use <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02013\">Ash 2X3ZB9CY<\/a> to block runs on ICEless servers. Possibly use them to protect asset economy as well.<\/p>\n\n<p>Try to keep the runner running and spending. You don\u2019t want to give them time to get their economy rolling. Once the runner is down to only a credit or two, consider putting out an agenda (particularly <a href=\"\/en\/card\/03023\">Gila Hands Arcology<\/a> or <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04119\">NAPD Contract<\/a>) to mess with their recovery plan. Often times if you\u2019re going to put out 3 for 2\u2019s on the board, two in a turn is better than one. The runner will hit one of them, assume they\u2019ve called your bluff and let you score the other in peace. These trades are actually a good idea in this deck, since with the rate you go through your deck and the economic advantage you should have you can often finish off a game that\u2019s 4\/4 in a couple of turns with <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01059\">Biotic Labor<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>The first few turns are the most critical, often enough. Ideally you want an unwary runner to think you have a bad draw with little ice and you\u2019re making the best of it, encouraging them to run you early rather than setting up their own economy. The temptation to trash things will hopefully set them back a little and let the deck snowball.<\/p>\n","username":"Leviathan","cards":{"01055":3,"01056":3,"01059":3,"01060":2,"01061":2,"01070":3,"01109":2,"02013":2,"02051":3,"02092":3,"03008":2,"03009":2,"03015":3,"03017":1,"03023":2,"04015":3,"04050":1,"04111":1,"04114":1,"04119":3,"06021":1,"06022":2,"06023":2}}]

The goal of this deck is actually kind of the opposite of the Atman deck. You want to get Darwin up and running as quickly as possible to be a threat but then save up money to pull out Atman only for big ice. Use tutors and\/or card draw to bring Darwin out as soon as you can, but try to get it on an Omni-Drive, as that will make feeding the whale free.

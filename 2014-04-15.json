Even in a tournament setting, it performed very well. It has only lost to the two finalists at a Store Champ, as well as a friend (once) who has been crushed by it time and time again. I am not bragging about the deck, but asking for help. I feel like setting up Yog and Dino is very slow, and it has econ problems early game. Is this a piloting error, or a deckbuilding one? I also want to add exposing and\/or net damage protection now that H&amp;P is coming out (hence the Deus Ex). Anyway, any advice is appreciated, hopefully you guys can inspire me.<\/h2>\n\n<p>Note: Decoy is there instead of Plascrete. Probably an incredibly risky move, but its cheaper to install and I usually encounter sea source over midseasons while playing against scorched decks. Punitive doesn't terrify me nearly as much.

Like most other Shaper decks, your plan will be to build your rig and run, with a focus on R&amp;D. But with Wyldside in the mix, the pace and style of how this happens is drastically different. <\/p>\n\n<p>The biggest difference is your economy. Instead of relying on clicking for creds with Kati or Magnum Opus, it will be focused on Sure Gamble, Dirty Laundry, and Daily Casts. And with (at least) two cards being drawn a turn, you will be surprised how well this keeps up (eventually, when you draw the Magnum Opus, it is a nice supplement, especially for handling huge late-game ice, but it really isn't needed in the beginning). Your rig consists of Corroder, Gordian Blade, and Dino-Garrote. It gets built like \u201cnormal\u201d, drawing into breakers, and using Test Run + Scavenge to dig for them where needed. Plus, you have Atman and Femme Fatale to help handle any big annoying stuff that comes up in the late game. And the meat of your point scoring will likely come from Indexing and The Maker\u2019s Eyes.<\/p>\n\n<p>But the truly best part of this deck is in the late game. Once your rig is built and you are out of cards, instead of selling Wyldside to Aesop's, just use a Levy AR Labs Access to start it all over again! But this time around, instead of drawing into boring cards to build your rig, you will be seeing nothing but economy cards (Sure Gamble, Dirty Laundry, and Daily Casts) and tricks (Indexing, The Maker\u2019s Eye, and Escher)! And this time around, those Test Runs and Scavenges can be used to reposition Atman and Femme Fatale very cheaply, for insane surprise attacks on servers, or just to make it real cheap to hit R&amp;D.<\/p>\n\n<p>So, seriously, who the hell let this kid into the nightclub?!?!<\/p>\n","username":"thewestwinds","cards":{"01007":1,"01016":3,"01026":1,"01036":3,"01043":1,"01044":1,"01047":1,"01050":3,"02009":2,"02046":1,"02047":3,"02048":2,"02106":3,"03031":1,"03034":3,"03035":2,"03038":1,"03040":1,"03052":3,"03053":3,"04065":1,"04067":1}},{"id":4240,"name":"Shaping Coming Events","creation":"2014-04-15 19:07:47","description":"<p>I decided to try and play Shaper a bit like Criminal, making this deck very event-heavy.

The key to beating Plascrete in the lategame is bluffing out a Snare! and forcing the runner to run it. In order to accomplish this, you have to score at least 2-3 points in smaller agendas before playing out the Snare! in a remote server, and choose a point in the game where the runner does not have the resources on board to get through your server but you think they have a card that will get them through in their hand (Inside Job, Sure Gamble, or anything else that will make them think they've ruined your maths).<\/p>\n\n<p>It is unlikely that a runner will run on their last click, but most will run on the second or third click, not allowing them to get back up to four cards if they choose to remove the tag from Snare! (which they have to not to die to triple Scorched). <\/p>\n\n<p>Otherwise, if they don't have Plascrete, winning is just about using Jackson and Green Level to draw into combo pieces, and the smaller ICE to protect your centrals long enough for you to assemble it.

I figured Grifter would be interesting, as well as Omega.  Both cards combo semi-well with Kit. She can usually make at least 1 successful run per turn (Grifter), and she already walks through the first piece of ICE with Torch, but that second?  That's what Omega is for.  When the corp really starts layering?  Parasite, Datasucker, Clone Chip.  Win condition?  R&amp;D dig, like always.<\/p>\n","username":"bcavalier","cards":{"01008":2,"01012":3,"01035":3,"01037":3,"01038":2,"01050":3,"02009":2,"02027":1,"02047":3,"02089":1,"02106":2,"02107":3,"03028":1,"03034":3,"03038":3,"03046":3,"03049":2,"03053":2,"04046":2,"04047":1,"04088":1}}]

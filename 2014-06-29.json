I picked CT because I feel the shaper recursion is really clutch with being able to be liberal with your overminds and run early and often, and the extra MU and reduced deck size are also useful. <\/p>\n\n<p>The idea is to get out an early deep red and overmind and run everywhere. An early opus is key as well, even though it eats up MU for overmind, I've found that 5 counters is more than enough early, especially with recursion. And later on, as knights come out, even a few counters can work to get you in when you need to. Late game, grabbing breakers off of personal workshop, getting the Fem, Torch, inti, and some knights out as my full suite, although I haven had a game that has gotten to that point yet. <\/p>\n\n<p>Thoughts from playtesting thus far:<\/p>\n\n<p>Really love the legworks. Great in an opening hand, and really great after hitting R&amp;D hard for a bit, forcing them to ice up, then recovering and hitting HQ once they've drawn a few agendas. I'd love an Same old thing to be able to recur one if needed. Next version of the deck may go down to two indexing and pop in the same old thing for more flexibility. <\/p>\n\n<p>Haven't really ever gotten to use the personal workshop to get my late game suite out yet. This may be partially due to the more aggressive early game running I like to do with the deck, usually I am hesitant to take the clicks to play the workshop and host ice when I could be getting more accesses. Usually between the knights and overmind, I get in where I need to get in. I do like the idea as the backup, if for some reason knight and overmind can't get me in, or I get unlucky with accesses early and run out of steam. <\/p>\n\n<p>The deck is super reliant on an early opus, as it's really my only econ beside the Sure gambles, and to a degree the personal workshops. I would love some other econ, but outside of dirty laundry, I am not sure what to add.

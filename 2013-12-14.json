Just tear apart every ICE the Corp plays on HQ and run it using Pheromones\/Vamp to keep them poor. Economy is Kati Jones and nothing else so  a little worrisome since Anarch do better with C:gain 2c actions than shaper or criminal. I could go -3 Kati for +3 Armitage and -3 clone chip for +2 LALA, +1 Crypsis. Never run R&amp;D until the corp is poor and you have a rook (or 2) on R&amp;D ICE. If they can't rez anything it's a free access. I think the deck is too slow right now and would actually go better with Whizzard since your economy is so weak his 3rc to trash will be huge against HB:campaign drip economy decks and JackHo\/SanSan grid\/etc. Every program is vital imo, I wish I could get enough draw in here to run Freelance coding contracts. 24 programs would get it done. I may try a criminal build with vamp. Syphon\/Vamp combo with pheromones and HQ focus could be interesting. At the least it would be a nonstandard archetype. Unless It's being done somewhere else already. lol<\/p>\n","username":"HepatitvsJ","cards":{"01002":2,"01006":2,"01007":1,"01008":3,"01009":3,"01010":1,"01011":1,"01012":3,"01050":3,"01051":2,"02003":3,"02021":3,"02041":1,"02086":3,"02087":3,"02091":3,"03038":3,"03054":2,"04003":3,"04041":1}},{"id":960,"name":"wombocombo","creation":"2013-12-14 01:25:08","description":"\n","username":"Milchtee","cards":{"01080":1,"01081":3,"01083":3,"01084":2,"01086":2,"01088":2,"01099":2,"01109":3,"01110":3,"01111":2,"02056":3,"02059":1,"02097":2,"02115":3,"02120":1,"04014":3,"04015":3,"04016":1,"04034":3,"04052":3,"04058":2,"04059":2}},{"id":961,"name":"Chess in the Park, Exile Style","creation":"2013-12-14 01:33:17","description":"\n","username":"lynkfox","cards":{"01026":2,"01034":3,"01042":1,"01044":3,"02009":2,"02047":3,"02048":2,"02066":1,"02087":2,"03030":1,"03033":3,"03034":3,"03035":1,"03038":3,"03040":1,"03044":2,"03046":3,"03054":1,"04002":3,"04003":1,"04022":2,"04043":3}},{"id":962,"name":"Exiled Chess","creation":"2013-12-14 01:45:23","description":"<p>Yes, I know Scheherazade doesnt work with with Cassia.

I had trouble getting the Datasucker early, or I would take an opening hand with a Datasucker but then I would have no starting breakers, or poor economy... The usual anarch problem of variance.<\/p>\n\n<p>In this deck I set out to create an anarch deck that does not use Datasucker or Djinn. I feel Reina has a unique style when used in conjunction with Deep Red, as they allow caissa held in your hand to act as pseudo-criminal events that remain in play until the ice is trashed. <\/p>\n\n<p>2 copies of all 3 anarch breakers helps cut down on draw variance and ensures you will almost always start with 1 copy of one of the three breakers. This deck stuck with the basics to help deal with the classic anarch draw problem. Clone chips are paramount to the deck! Trashed caissa in your heap will come to your rescue in the greatest of ways when face-checking ice; having Deep Red installed means bringing a bishop out of your heap and onto a Tollbooth or Viktor 2.0 mid-run, or onto an Archer (with Ice Carver installed). <\/p>\n\n<p>You strive to punish the corp for trying to over-ice by using Reina's ability along with Rook. Force them to pay the 3 (sometimes 5 if I have 2 Rooks in play on a 2-3 deep unrezzed server) credits to rez the ice, using the threat of a Clone Chipped Parasite to trash cheap taxing ice, or Knight to guarantee breaking the ice, as a way to pressure the Corp. Deja Vu helps support this style of play. You will find you are fishing for 2 things with it; either parasites to recur, or Knights after the corp trashes what turns out to be a Wraparound or Grim to try and keep your Knights off the ice. Your suite should end up being Corroder\/Mimic\/Yog and Medium, and if the opportunity for the power turn presents itself, trash whatever breaker you don't need in order to access R&amp;D to Clone Chip in a second Medium and go hard for the win.<\/p>\n\n<p>Caissa choices throughout the game vary. Bishop can function as a psuedo-Surge to help finish off a piece of ice unexpectedly to the Corp for the mere cost of 1 click, this also gets the Bishop into your heap and ready for Clone Chip play. Rooks are your favorite early caissa (obviously) but you have to know when Bishops start mattering more, since your caissa play will be limited to 3 once you get your full suite. Watch the Corps economy, operations and assets already played\/in play, and look for their tempo to slow. This is your window to run hard and apply pressure; make the Corp make decisions about which ice they want to rez when they can't afford to rez it all.<\/p>\n\n<p>I use Kati Jones as an economic slingshot. Midseason and scorch are both popular in our meta, so under threat of a Midseason or SEA Source, you have Kati stacking up. Face check ice despite this, using the idea that you have to score or make a successful run to your advantage to pressure the Corp. Steal the NAPD, make the Archives run to force Jackson, and then clear Kati. When played smartly, enough credits can act as a Plascrete in themselves. Lucky Find is a very strong card and its cost works perfectly in this deck. Three credits should be treated as your threshold, avoid going under this amount unless you have Kati stacked up to 6 at least if not 9, so you don't have to click for credits.<\/p>\n\n<p>Liberated Accounts can be a controversial choice, but like I said, money is power for this deck. When you have your opponent on the ropes and you will have to stretch yourself beyond your means to keep the pressure up, instead drop Liberated for your third click and take 4 from it. Next turn, or any turn where the Corp hasn't recovered tempo, blast Liberated for the rest of its money. This surge of credits will make the Corp hold off on the scoring windows, usually pooling agendas into their hand, which you can use to your advantage.<\/p>\n\n<p>I made what I considered a solid anarch deck, and then realized I had used six influence. Diesel is a better choice then Professional Contacts because you need to be free to exert your power through the power turns I described, where you drop 2 caissas and then make a click 3 run on R&amp;D and man-mode your way through the server. <\/p>\n\n<p>Since winning the tournament (and a little bit before it started, to be honest) I have been wanting to put HQ pressure in here, but am torn between Nerve Agent and Legwork. With Deja Vu and limited memory I'm leaning towards dropping a Lucky Find for a Legwork, since consistently through every game of the tournament I managed to force Corps to hold agendas in HQ under threat of caissa assault on a remote or R&amp;D abuse.<\/p>\n","username":"ItJustGotRielle","cards":{"01002":2,"01007":2,"01010":3,"01011":2,"01012":3,"01014":2,"01015":2,"01034":2,"01050":3,"02022":2,"02091":3,"03038":3,"03052":3,"04003":3,"04021":2,"04041":1,"04042":3,"04043":3,"04109":2}},{"id":7793,"name":"Store Tournament Winner Dayton, OH - Keystone","creation":"2014-07-21 21:21:27","description":"<p>There is not much to say for this deck- speed is key. In practice I named this copy \"Back to Basics\", although GRNDL deck I have been playing in one version or another since its release has always been known as Keystone.<\/p>\n\n<p>Because of the tightened influence, I opted to not run the Accelerated Shutdown combo. I have a one-of <a href=\"\/en\/card\/05016\">Inazuma<\/a>, which is an MVP for this deck when I can fish it out with <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02018\">Project Atlas<\/a>, although I typically use Atlas as a way to threaten Scorch while my money runs high, or for Power Shutdown when money is low and I need a scoring window. Weyland as a whole, more so than other corps, has to know when they have a scoring window. Because of your easy to break binary ice, you rarely have more than 1 turn to squeak an agenda out. That's where the program trashing edge of this deck shines, namely Power Shutdown which is an amazing card. AMAZING card.<\/p>\n\n<p>Things you can Power Shutdown: <\/p>\n\n<p>-Datasucker for 1<\/p>\n\n<p>-Corroder for 2<\/p>\n\n<p>-Passport for 1<\/p>\n\n<p>-Clone Chip for 1<\/p>\n\n<p>-My personal favorites, Faerie and SMC both for 0.<\/p>\n\n<p>Runners are not idiots. You have to have HQ defended, have a remote set up, and be ready to give them the IAA. Wait for them to play a breaker or integral piece of their rig, then drop an agenda and advance it when you're holding a Power Shutdown or a Scorch\/SEA source. Force them to run on you, and then punish them.  This is what being Weyland is all about.  <\/p>\n\n<p>You dictate the pace of the game as Weyland. You start with 10 credits, so being Siphoned is basically the worst thing that can happen to you. Always expect it, even out of faction. Just do NOT let them have your HQ. You don't want them knowing you have 'the combo' ready. <\/p>\n\n<p>Early game, resist the urge to score that Hostile Takeover. Your priority is scoring that Atlas at 4 to get a single token on it. That token represents your control of this game. As long as it is unused, the runner will have to respect you. If they play a plascrete and run at you, you play the Power Shutdown game. If they refuse to run until they have the cash to match you, you put another agenda down and either score or make them run. If you know they can get in to that remote, bluff your agenda by playing a Hedge Fund\/Restructure click 1, and then installed a Hostile Takeover for Click 2 and advancing it once. Let them burn themselves out for a single point, this gives your your score window when you Shutdown a key breaker on your next turn, then install and advance the next Atlas (or Geothermal if you don't have an Atlas). <\/p>\n\n<p>Jacksons serve multiple purposes (as usual, that's why he's so good). Install him on your last click early in the game to keep your opponent guessing, hoping they'll face check the remote with the Grim or Inazuma into Archer server. If you have the balls to, with the Jackson down Shutdown for 5 and kill that early Opus (but seriously, probably don't do that :P). I primarily use Jacksons as a way to recur Power Shutdowns. Yes, they're that good. <\/p>\n\n<p>On that note, criminal is your hardest matchup, because you can't flip a Grim and trash an event. Know how to bait the Inside Jobs. Shutdown their first Faerie or Corroder and see how they react. Andromeda is still very popular and still very dependent on Datasucker, which is an easy shutdown, and in the world of deck tuning very few people still run Lemuria Codecracker or Inti specifically for Shutdown protection anymore, so you can guarantee trashing that first Datasucker. <\/p>\n\n<p>Things to avoid:<\/p>\n\n<p>-An opener that involves 2 code gates or 2 barriers installed as your first two ice on HQ and R&amp;D. Special Order and Test Run exist, and Siphon and Indexing are still in about 50% of ever deck under the sun. <\/p>\n\n<p>-Remember that a runner knows you will set program trashing ice in front of ETR ice. This can be important to know when it comes to Inside Job and Test Running a Femme. Let them Inside Job an ETR in front and walk into a Grim and onto R&amp;D. They'll be spending a lot of credits to break through the Grim, even if they do get the access. Weyland has inherent risk involved.<\/p>\n\n<p>-Don't telegraph what you have in HQ. <\/p>\n\n<p>Example 1: Do not play 2 Restructures and then set 'something' in a remote. These brazen attempts to 'call out' the runner are asking for trouble. You will get account siphoned. They will Security Test it. Or typically, they will just run it and then last click drop a Plascrete and ruin your plan B. Subtlety is key. You dictate the pace of the game, and your strength lies in what they runner thinks you are capable of. This is why is is paramount to guard HQ more than R&amp;D when only 1 is viable. <\/p>\n\n<p>Example 2: Do not telegraph that you have \"the combo in hand\" by drawing no more than once a turn, but not playing anything but redundant ice, or additional economy cards. Agendas are being drawn, and they are going somewhere. Not into remotes... so where? Archives? Or HQ? You can NOT stop moving, or you'll be overtaken by the runner. Do not force the scorch opportunity. <\/p>\n\n<p>Set your remotes up with varying ice types with the goal of getting a Shutdown off on a key breaker, and then use that scoring window. Enigma is best served on centrals, because losing a click doesn't particularly matter when they're running your remote. Get the Quandary on a remote as a 1 cost ice they have to fish for a 4 -5 cost decoder for. Don't let them have a breaker suite. Separate your ice variety across key remotes and centrals so that the runner has to choose which server to focus when fishing for breakers or using their recursion to bring them back. Best of luck trying the deck, and remember, PLAY FAST AND CONTROL THE PACE!<\/p>\n","username":"ItJustGotRielle","cards":{"01064":2,"01086":2,"01094":3,"01098":3,"01099":3,"01101":3,"01103":3,"01110":3,"01111":3,"01113":3,"02018":3,"02077":2,"04015":2,"04017":3,"04020":2,"04040":3,"04058":3,"04097":1,"04120":2,"05016":1}},{"id":7794,"name":"nbn first fry ","creation":"2014-07-21 21:24:46","description":"<p>only ownd card<\/p>\n","username":"zyp","cards":{"01081":2,"01082":2,"01083":2,"01084":2,"01086":2,"01088":2,"01090":2,"01091":2,"01099":2,"01101":2,"01106":2,"01110":3,"01113":3,"02055":3,"02056":3,"02114":1,"02115":3,"05024":3}},{"id":7795,"name":"Silhouette (A new tournament season deck)","creation":"2014-07-21 21:44:09","description":"<p>My project is to try to learn how to pilot this deck.

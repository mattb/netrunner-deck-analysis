Early in the build, Enigma and Fenris punish no-icebreaker server intrusion. Later, Bioroid Efficiency Research and Oversight AI provide maximum uptime for your Januses and Heimdall. If they are trashed, fear not; Howler and NBN\u2019s very own Jackson Howard will recur them. Rumor has it that Director Haas is working on a project of her own for that purpose, as well.<\/p>\n\n<p>Place a Zed 1.0 or Howler on an Awakening Center for unexpected damage. Howlers can also be installed over HQ or R&amp;D as a one-shot deterrence for Account Siphons, Maker\u2019s Eyes, and Indexings. Sufficient funds funnel in by way of company Hedge Funds, Adonis advertising Campaigns, and long-range mining operations on Arrakis. An Oversight AI\u2019d bioroid will protect these assets.<\/p>\n\n<p>Despite Jinteki and HB\u2019s long-held rivalry, the loyalty of Jinteki\u2019s Zaibatsu conglomerates guarantee the effectiveness of your cerebral overwriters. Install, advance, advance, and have no fear. The Zaibatsu insurance policy is most forgiving.<\/p>\n\n<p>Arrive at 6 agenda points as quickly as possible to maximize pressure on the Runner. The acquisition of a Sentinel Defense Program along the way similarly mounts pressure. When someone is pressured, they take risks. Risks lead to damage. Damage leads to flatline.<\/p>\n\n<p>Finally, if the runner is ever kind enough to provide you with their location, this build has one last ace-in-the-hole. Call our corporate allies at the Weyland Consortium and incinerate them. While HB does not endorse the Scorched Earth policy, it recognizes the necessity to sacrifice certain infrastructures in order to ensure the security of its customers.<\/p>\n\n<p>Every runner is a criminal. Show no mercy. Punish their intrusions. A flatlined runner is the ultimate deterrence. And remember, vote HB for the Chronos Protocol!<\/p>\n","username":"ZenCadenza","cards":{"00004":1,"01056":3,"01064":1,"01071":2,"01099":1,"01106":2,"01108":2,"01110":3,"01111":2,"02012":2,"02079":3,"03004":1,"03006":2,"03007":3,"03009":3,"03013":2,"03015":1,"03016":2,"03019":1,"03020":2,"03021":2,"03023":1,"04015":3,"04059":2,"04071":3}},{"id":1777,"name":"Exile Recursion Efficiency","creation":"2014-01-28 02:27:22","description":"<p>Attempting another replicator deck with Exile<\/p>\n","username":"shazzner","cards":{"01011":2,"01014":2,"01021":2,"01026":2,"01047":2,"01050":3,"02047":2,"02048":2,"02065":3,"02088":2,"02107":2,"03030":1,"03034":2,"03035":2,"03038":2,"03046":2,"03048":2,"03049":2,"03052":3,"04029":3,"04066":3}},{"id":1778,"name":"Chaos Scavenge","creation":"2014-01-28 04:40:22","description":"\n","username":"oppi","cards":{"01026":3,"01034":3,"01050":3,"02004":1,"02009":2,"02046":1,"02047":3,"02048":2,"02091":2,"02101":2,"03034":3,"03052":2,"03053":3,"03054":3,"04027":3,"04029":3,"04047":1,"04065":1}},{"id":1779,"name":"Tag n'Bad ... pub","creation":"2014-01-28 07:47:33","description":"\n","username":"bot2563","cards":{"01058":2,"01064":1,"01080":1,"01081":2,"01084":2,"01085":2,"01090":3,"01092":2,"01098":3,"01101":2,"01103":1,"01107":2,"01111":2,"01113":2,"02070":2,"02115":3,"02116":3,"04015":2,"04020":1,"04035":1,"04039":3,"04056":2,"04076":3,"04080":3}},{"id":1780,"name":"Tag n'Bad ... pub","creation":"2014-01-28 07:53:00","description":"\n","username":"bot2563","cards":{"01058":2,"01064":1,"01080":1,"01081":2,"01084":1,"01085":2,"01090":3,"01092":2,"01098":3,"01101":2,"01107":2,"01110":3,"01111":2,"01113":2,"02115":3,"02116":3,"03015":1,"04015":2,"04020":1,"04039":3,"04056":2,"04076":3,"04080":3}},{"id":1781,"name":"Re-engineering your cerebelum","creation":"2014-01-28 08:03:51","description":"<p>This deck on average lands 2-3 brain damage which then makes neural emp a peice of cake to land.<\/p>\n","username":"CodeMarvelous","cards":{"01054":1,"01055":3,"01056":3,"01062":3,"01063":3,"01072":3,"01108":3,"02012":1,"02051":3,"02053":3,"02070":3,"02092":2,"02110":3,"03005":1,"03007":3,"03015":2,"03017":1,"03019":3,"04015":3,"04071":3}},{"id":1782,"name":"Tag n'Bad ... pub V2","creation":"2014-01-28 08:06:26","description":"<p>Midseason Replacements + Psychographics + Project Vitruvius for more fun ...<\/p>\n","username":"bot2563","cards":{"01055":3,"01058":2,"01062":2,"01064":1,"01085":2,"01098":3,"01101":1,"01107":2,"01110":3,"01111":2,"01113":2,"02012":1,"02051":2,"02070":3,"02110":3,"02116":2,"03002":1,"03015":2,"03017":2,"04011":1,"04015":3,"04020":1,"04039":3,"04080":3}},{"id":1783,"name":"Shut Archives Down","creation":"2014-01-28 09:51:22","description":"<p>A close idea to Spam that Button, but without showing the runner what you are doing.

Huge ice leave you vulnerable to derez effects, but I frequently have ~30 credits floating, so I can sweat 1 or 2 derez.  Cash also helps keep the threat of sea source hanging out there over their heads.<\/p>\n\n<p>This deck can fairly consistently rez big ice on both HQ and archives to protect itself from cheap shutdowns.  And when it makes a remote fort, boy is it expensive to get in.  To make big ice effective, you have to be able to drag the runner down that column of ice.  To that end, I have 6 copies of cards that can be played for a beneficial effect, and vanish as the runner passes the last ice.  Mills clears your bad pub (you will have a lot!), and jackson reshuffles your economy, all while forcing the runner to make a move.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Naturally to apply the above concept, you need to be rushing out agendas.  Putting down a govt contracts behind a hadrians with an ireress on top (to prevent inside job), lets you get to near match point with 1 more agenda (project atlas with 2 counters = game...pretty much).  This plays very rushy, while forcing both breakers and economy, while still threatening a sea source (runner blows their cash beating the ice).<\/p>\n\n<p>Now the elephant in the room.  Why Ireress??  Funny thing happens with ireress....if you have no other ice that requires a code gate breaker, they have to dump 5 on yog to offset bad pub, which is a tough value proposition.  I left tollbooth in because it still costs yog 3 IF yog can even beat it.  Otherwise its fully functional against any other code gate breaker.  Ireress is a lot better when you give yog no other purpose.  Also, free inside job protection!<\/p>\n\n<p>Possible edits: Instead of Janus, Muckraker seems to be a good option, surprise tagging (only rez when they'll stick), and you can clear the bad pub with elizabeth.

I find it very difficult to play against.<\/p>\n","username":"PsymonTheWizard","cards":{"01067":1,"01070":3,"01072":3,"01077":3,"01109":2,"01110":2,"02032":3,"02055":3,"02095":3,"03015":2,"03019":2,"03023":3,"04033":2,"04073":2,"04119":3,"05004":3,"05006":1,"05011":2,"05016":2,"05017":3,"05022":2}},{"id":5615,"name":"Jinteki Asylum","creation":"2014-05-15 12:58:47","description":"\n","username":"Magnetic","cards":{"01057":1,"01069":2,"01090":1,"01110":3,"02039":1,"02052":2,"02056":2,"02110":2,"04013":2,"04015":2,"04074":2,"04100":2,"04114":3,"04119":3,"05001":1,"05007":3,"05009":2,"05011":3,"05014":2,"05015":3,"05018":3}},{"id":5616,"name":"DoublePainter","creation":"2014-05-15 13:39:57","description":"<p>A deck made from leftovers in my collection, plays out pretty decent though<\/p>\n","username":"wegemo","cards":{"01026":2,"01028":1,"01033":1,"01034":3,"01035":3,"01041":2,"01043":3,"01044":1,"01045":1,"01048":2,"01050":3,"02047":3,"02091":2,"04004":1,"04008":3,"04027":3,"04063":2,"04086":2,"04107":2,"04108":3,"04109":3}},{"id":5617,"name":"Gambito de Dama","creation":"2014-05-15 14:00:49","description":"<p>This is a deck based on comments and suggestions made by @xx3r0h0ur and @accless on a previous deck, 'This is a matter of Chess'.

I've been testing and twekaing it on OCTGN for the past week or so, and now it's time to get some feedback.<\/p>\n\n<p>Breakers: I'm using the most efficient breakers available for each type of ICE. Mimic is for before you get Cloak\/Silencer &amp; Dagger set up, or to break small Sentries in order to save Dagger for the bigger ones. Even if you don't have a Mimic out, there are enough Stealth credits in this deck for Dagger to be able to break through a sever stacked with sentries. <\/p>\n\n<p>Torch is the only Code Gate breaker, and there's only one copy of it. That makes it the priority Test Run\/Scavenge target. Once you get it out, it shouldn't cost you much to use it because of the 3xLockpicks.<\/p>\n\n<p>Corroder is Corroder, not much I need to say about why it's good. I will note that you should try to host it on an Omni-Drive, as there are no dedicated recurring credits for Fracters.<\/p>\n\n<p>Deus X was thrown in for Jinteki match-ups and for things like Janus, Viktor, and the like BEFORE you have your rig up. Having Deus X installed lets you run a lot more comfortably against Jinteki because you can handle a Snare! or an advanced Junebug without losing any momentum. <\/p>\n\n<p>Hardware: Obviously this deck is full of hardware that give recurring credits that make runs cheap\/free. With Kate's ability you can install most of these for free, which you should be taking advantage of every single turn. Inside Man is there to help with the bigger Hardware such as CyberSolutions Mem Chip, R&amp;D Interface, and HQ Interface.<\/p>\n\n<p>ToolBox is the Console of choice because it gives you everything you need: 2xRecurring Credits, 2xLink, and 2xMU. The recurring credits are obviously what this deck wants, and ToolBox's can be used for any type of breaker. The Link helps a lot because you're generally not going to have many \"real\" credits to fight traces. As for the MU, there is exactly as much MU in this deck as there are programs to use the MU. Very rarely do I actually install everything, but I usually do have most of my MU used by the end of the game, and the +2 MU on ToolBox is a useful bonus.<\/p>\n\n<p>Replicator is an absolute star in this deck. There's so much Hardware you're absolutely going to get mileage out of it. Replicator makes sure you always have something to install. Every turn. That's good. It helps you get your rig set up very quickly. The other thing Replicator is for is thinning your deck. When you click to draw a card you want to be getting a breaker or an event. You don't want to have to mill through extra hardware. Replicator makes sure you don't have to. And finally, Replicator keeps your hand size high without you needing to spend clicks. This means your not losing tempo by drawing for hand size against Jinteki or Weyland, which lets you keep running!<\/p>\n\n<p>The R&amp;D and HQ Interfaces let you put pressure on any server. When your rig gets up and running the Corp will not have a server safe from you, and when you start installing Interfaces they will realize they can't neglect ICE'ing up a server. Even when I rarely ran HQ, the fact that I had an HQ Interface made Corps install 1-2 more pieces of ICE on HQ.<\/p>\n\n<p>Plascrete Carapace is obvious Tag &amp; Bag defense. But notably with Replicator you can get both Placretes out at once, meaning you're safe for most of the game.<\/p>\n\n<p>Events: Most of these are standard. Diesel helps you draw when you can't find your last breaker. Indexing is to gain intel on the Corp deck and put more pressure on R&amp;D. Test Run\/Scavenge help you get something out quickly and cheaply. If you already have all of your breakers out use Test Run for Cloak or Opus as necessary. Use Scavenge to put Corroder on Omni-Drive.<\/p>\n\n<p>Thoughts: So, this deck has a pretty good win rate on OCTGN and several of the losses were due to my errors, not the deck itself. However, this deck HATES Tollbooth. I understand most Runners do, but having to pay 3 \"real\" credits hurts because this deck generally doesn't have a lot of extra \"real\" credits to give away. This deck also is lacking ways to retrive cards from the Heap. Test Run can get programs out that were lost from random damage, or so you can recur Deus X, but that's it. So, getting hit with random net damage sometimes hurts.<\/p>\n\n<p>I am usually able to get my rig out before the Corp can get comfortable. Against non-FA decks, I just try to lock down the scoring server while continually adding to my Hardware.<\/p>\n\n<p>FA decks are difficult, and the way I deal with them is locking down R&amp;D. I've won against NBN AstroBiotics a couple times because they lack of ICE protetcing any servers meant I was free to do whatever I wanted. HB FA is more difficult, but I the same strategy should work. Just make sure to kill SanSan as soon as you can.<\/p>\n\n<p>Sorry for the super long explanation, but I'm pretty excited for this deck. It's the first Runner deck I've felt satisfied with. Any feedback would be appreciated. Feel free to test it out, and I'll be doing further testing it on OCTGN (Username: EnjoiThePureTrip).<\/p>\n","username":"EnjoiThePureTrip","cards":{"01005":2,"01007":2,"01011":1,"01033":1,"01034":3,"01041":2,"01044":2,"01050":3,"02009":2,"02047":3,"02066":1,"02068":1,"02085":1,"02088":2,"02106":2,"02107":2,"03034":3,"03039":2,"03041":3,"03042":2,"04006":3,"04047":1,"04086":1,"04104":2}},{"id":3664,"name":"Jinteki Replicating Perfection","creation":"2014-03-31 12:15:57","description":"<p>The focus of this deck is economy through assets, and forcing the runner to spend a lot of clicks and money to weaken that economy.

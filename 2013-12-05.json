I've removed 3x Diesel because Prof Contacts is really the draw\/economy engine in this deck. I've also switched Armitage for Daily Casts to better synergize with using your clicks to hit it. Prof Contacts is so important for this deck that I recommend taking the mulligan to try to get it in your opening hand. That said Kati, Daily Casts, Sahasrara, and\/or Scheherazade can keep you functioning without it and I feel it is consistent enough not to need Diesel as a backup plan. Two cards you want to install early are Sahasrara and Djinn. I like to Test Run Sahasrara, use its credits to install Djinn, and then install Sahasrara back on Djinn the next turn... but I definitely find it worth it to use SMC to bring out Sahasrara as you will make back that 4 credits in no time... and while you can't use Sahasrara to pay the SMC trash cost those 2 creds can be the difference between being able to bring out and use a breaker mid run or not.  Once you've got your rig set up Scavenge it for a Parasite or whatever. Scheherazade can be a bit risky (especially once Mala Tempora is out) but it's a great place to Test Run onto or put SMC, Faerie, Deus X, Crecentus, Imp, or anything else temporary (or that losing won't lose you the game) - those credits add up. Otherwise it plays like any Anarch Shaper with fixed strength breakers and Datasuckers to make running as cheap as possible since the Prof ain't rich.  Getting out a Morning Star-asaurus (What are these \"barriers\" you speak of?!) or Femme with a Test Run->Scavenge combo is super fun but don't hoard those cards in your hand trying to make it happen. The first cards to me on the chopping block for changes are probably Crescentus (awesome but situational) and Scheherazade (great money but a little scary) or Plascrete if you don't play against Tag and Bag.

All the ice in this deck are advance-able and serve not only as protection but as forms of economy as well as methods to score agendas with. The idea is to set up your ice, preferably covering your bases at first, and advancing them whenever possible using the identity ability, operation cards, and clicks when capable. By compounding several advancement counters on different pieces of ice (and potentially the assets they're protecting) you can use cards like Trick of Light and Shipment from Kaguya and SanSan to move these advancements towards agendas and assets to score quickly at crucial points in the game. This can allow the Corp to take control of the pace of the game somewhat and throw the Runner through a loop with things like Ghost Branch which makes them think twice about running servers remote recklessly.\r\n\r\nThis deck of course requires a good amount of economy in order to advance all it's ice, assets, and ultimately agendas. This is accomplished through cards like Hedge Fund, Commercialization, Beanstalk, and even the agendas once they've been scored. With a steady flow of credits you can advance as much as possible which enables you to build up your walls of defense and trim off of them when you need to in order to score agendas\/assets. The trick to making this deck work is monitoring the levels of advancements on your ice and making sure you have enough on them to trim off if you need them while still being strong enough to hold off run attempts on crucial servers. Once they're strong enough to trim off of you can install agendas and score them more quickly with the Op cards. Then once you've run short of Op cards Jackson Howard can bring them back into your deck to be reused.\r\n\r\nAny and all advice and suggestions are welcome, thanks!","username":"skaterforsale","cards":{"01087":1,"01094":2,"01098":3,"01100":2,"01102":1,"01103":3,"01104":3,"01110":3,"02018":3,"02033":3,"02057":2,"02058":3,"02076":1,"02077":2,"02078":2,"02098":3,"02099":2,"04015":3,"04017":2,"04018":2,"04034":2,"04039":2}},{"id":796,"name":"HB SanSan FA","creation":"2013-12-05 14:31:26","description":"<p>This is a pretty standard fast advance\/rush deck.

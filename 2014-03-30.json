I made this deck a week before the event, and was still making significant changes to it two days beforehand.  I'm not sure how good this deck actually is, but it has a few qualities that I really like:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Its speed puts the runner under pressure and punishes slow\/durdly runner decks.  You won't lose any games to \"never run until they can use Activist Support + New Angeles City Hall to set up blackmail\" decks, for example.<\/li>\n<li>It's high variance.  I don't think you win many games against good runners using safe corp decks.  I'd rather allow a lot of free accesses and win when they don't hit too many agendas than try to defend everything and lose most of the time.<\/li>\n<li>It matches up decently against Gabe.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>The basic plan is to be super aggressive (and I do mean SUPER aggressive) and score agendas behind a 1-3 ice remote until the remote isn't safe anymore, after which you're trying to score the rest from hand with Biotic Labor (or Shipment from SanSan, if you were able to score an Efficiency Committee).  Also part of the plan: don't lose to Account Siphon.<\/p>\n\n<p>Some thoughts on changes that I think should be made:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Caduceus should probably be replaced - it's great against some runners, but very weak in some of your less favorable matchups (Andy and Reina, in particular)<\/li>\n<li>I wasn't happy with Blue Level Clearance; I think it should be some other econ card.

The end result is a deck possessing both significant early game pressure and a solid long game.<\/p>\n\n<p>A few notes:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>No Corroder!?!<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Yes, I love getting an early Desperado that much.  Inti lets you get through cheap barriers early while the difference between Snowball and Corroder in the late game is not <em>too<\/em> significant (you might even get to live the dream and make a snowman!  but probably not).<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>No Plascretes?  No Levy AR?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Both of these cards are dead most of the time, and not essential in the situations where they're useful.  I am of the opinion that Plascretes are for suckers outside of tag-me decks, but they're especially unnecessary here: you have the eco to avoid being SEA Scorched, and you can control your vulnerability to Snare \/ Punitive.  Sometimes you will end up in a super long game where your stack starts to run out (especially with Professional Contacts) - every time this has happened to me I have been able to win anyways.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>One Tinkering?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Tinkering is the one card in this deck that I think should be replaced (probably by Deus X).  More generally, one thing that I didn't like about the original version of this deck was the one time nature of Scavenge and Tinkering - they'd end up sitting in my hand forever.  On paper those cards make you flexible but in practice there's a huge difference between being able to continually adjust and being able to adjust once.  I rarely use Scavenge to re-point Cybers and Femmes; they're better off being used to cheat out Torch\/Femme with Test Run or for getting back Sharpshooter.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Are there any changes you would make?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>While I don't think there are any obviously correct changes to be made (outside of the previously mentioned Deus X for Tinkering), there's definitely room for tweaking to suit your playstyle.  Just keep in mind that any change you make to improve your early game will probably weaken your late game, and vice versa.  Paintbrush is interesting; I'm going to try it out.  If you have ideas that you think would improve the deck I would love to hear them!<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Anything else?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Sure, have some random thoughts:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Cheating out an early Torch feels so unfair<\/li>\n<li>Sharpshooter is SO GOOD; I don't think this deck would work without it.  Having an SMC out lets you continue runs when you would otherwise have to jack out for fear of program-trashing ice.  Clone Chip (and Scavenge) can let you ignore huge pieces of ice (e.g. Archer) that you would otherwise have to pay a ton to break with Femme<\/li>\n<li>You could probably safely cut one Kati Jones.  I'm afraid to do so because there are some matchups where you really need her<\/li>\n<li>The deck's biggest weakness in general is the potential for clunky early game draws.  I'm not sure if this is a fixable problem<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<hr \/>\n\n<p>I hope you enjoy this deck :)<\/p>\n","username":"Crunchums","cards":{"01024":3,"01026":1,"01034":3,"01037":1,"01050":3,"02027":1,"02047":3,"02091":3,"02107":2,"03028":1,"03031":1,"03034":3,"03038":3,"03043":1,"03044":3,"03046":3,"03048":1,"03049":3,"03052":3,"04006":2,"04047":1,"04067":1}},{"id":3641,"name":"Test Run Andy","creation":"2014-03-30 17:36:43","description":"<p>Most recent build.

Tennin offers a level of flexibility that other abilities don't: advancing is an essential part of winning netrunner whether it's an agenda, trap or piece of ice. \nThe biggest problem with this deck was the abilities condition: \"if the Runner did not make a successful run\". To succeed with Tennin you need to find ways to reliable end a lot of runs, especially early game, so that you can gain that extra special benefit of free advancement. Advancing a card is worth two clicks, one to get money and another to place the advancement token on it so it Tennin's ability is especially useful.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>STRATEGY<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Ice<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Playing advancable ice is a necessity in this deck as it gives you something to do with free advancements that you get when there's no agenda around. A strong Ice Wall or highly advanced Hadrian's Wall will sufficiently drain the runner enough and protect them from parasites. Chimera is a very good Paintbrush obstacle and allows you to be even more certain of keeping the runner out early game when they don't have every icebreaker. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Economy<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Snare allows you to play Celebrity Gift without too much exposure. Commercialisation is a fantastic card in this deck because you can actually make money from it rather than getting money back: ice that you've advanced for free is now an efficient source of economy, use Jackson to get Commercialisation back a few times. Sundew is of course a nice form of economy but you might have a hard time defending it in this deck, see below.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Servers<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Keep your servers to a minimum in this game, ideally five, all protected by at least 1 piece of ice: HQ, R&amp;D, Archives, Sundew and Agendas.\nYou need to protect every server early game otherwise the Runner will stop you from advancing things.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Tricks<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>This deck excels when you manage to use the available Nisei. Scoring Nisei MK II allows you to start a Nisei MK II train as you may be able to stop the runner accessing the next agenda, advance it once at the start of your turn and then 3 more times to score it. Caprice really helps, play her in a remote to make an agenda particularly hard to score. Akitaro can be used to make it free to repeatedly rez Chimera. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Traps<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Tennin is special: it can advance ANY card. So you can make a non advancable asset look like an agenda and confuse the Runner further. In this deck it can be amusing (if you have no other options) to advance an unrezzed piece of ice to give the impression that it is an Ice Wall or Hadrian's Wall, this ability to mislead the runner may prevent them from running until they have enough funds. You can of course use Trick of Light or Commercialisation to profit off of these useless advancements later.<\/p>\n","username":"sydan","cards":{"01068":3,"01070":3,"01079":2,"01090":1,"01102":2,"01103":3,"01110":3,"01111":2,"02014":3,"02033":3,"02058":2,"02060":3,"04012":3,"04013":3,"04015":2,"04054":3,"04074":2,"04114":2,"05003":1,"05005":3,"05006":1}},{"id":3645,"name":"Come get some!","creation":"2014-03-30 19:46:32","description":"<p>Jinteki punishment with tons of money.<\/p>\n","username":"elrodogg","cards":{"01056":2,"01067":1,"01068":3,"01069":2,"01070":3,"01072":2,"01075":2,"01077":2,"01078":3,"01079":2,"01098":2,"01100":2,"01110":3,"02014":3,"02032":3,"02092":2,"02095":2,"04013":2,"04033":2,"04053":2,"04074":2,"04093":3}},{"id":3646,"name":"Guiding Light v1.0","creation":"2014-03-30 20:58:43","description":"<p>End the run early with inexpensive ice as you lightly advance Ice Walls and Shadows while diging with GLC and Jackson for the cards you need.

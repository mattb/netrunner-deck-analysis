Well, I'm submitting this deck to play and have a good laugh while doing it.  I went 4 out of 5 tonight playing it, so it CAN win...it just requires you to understand how to build threats, and to balance risk.  Basically this is a weyland jinteki deck.  Essentially you're threatening meat damage all the time.<\/p>\n\n<p>So you can play out 3 remotes unprotected, doing pad-pad-drt or snare-drt-pad or whatever.  Just get DRT's in play.  Then get a data raven on a remote (with one on a central) then also get a false lead scored.  From there, false lead is your game winner.  <\/p>\n\n<p>I can explain more combos if you want, but theres so many threats that its a hoot to play.  Try it out for 5 games and then bring back comments.<\/p>\n","username":"x3r0h0ur","cards":{"01070":3,"01087":3,"01088":3,"01093":1,"01095":3,"01098":3,"01099":3,"01103":3,"01104":3,"01107":2,"01109":3,"01110":3,"01111":3,"02018":3,"02080":3,"02118":3,"02120":2,"03026":3}},{"id":1160,"name":"ParaKate v2.0","creation":"2013-12-30 01:31:15","description":"<p>Kate-parasite recursion deck for effortless running.

The deck uses mostly 3 pointers since they would provide the maximum damage with that, and there's little ICE since you're supposed to flatline the Runner, not waste your time advancing Agendas!<\/p>\n\n<p>Anyway, there's also big pieces of ICE to help possibly scoring a 5\/3 in early game. If you manage to score The Cleaners, after all, things should become way smoother.<\/p>\n\n<p>Jackson Howard should help recycle both PC and Snare!, but maybe 3 copies are overkill. Just didn't know what to do exactly with that last influence point... a Wall of Thorns, maybe?<\/p>\n\n<p>Also, one less Data Raven to add a single SEA Source could help against \"overly\" cautious Runners.<\/p>\n\n<p>Power Grid Overlay is there to take care of those damn Plascrete Carapace that people like to have against Weyland. And plenty of economy cards to have the money to actually manage to blow'em up for good.\nCommercialization because you should really advance those Hadrians, Ice Walls and possibly Shadow. Less ICE means it'll have to be harder to pass, or you could as well go without, right?<\/p>\n\n<p>Finally, the name is obviously a reference to  corporal punishment, it's \"meat\" damage after all! But it's also a reference to WWII, and the British mission who took place in...

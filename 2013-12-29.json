The concept was to use stimhack and pw to install things early and use spinal modem as a cheap toolbox.  It doesn't really work, but if the corp doesn't win by the time you get everything out then you can probably win.<\/p>\n\n<p>Anyway, Notes to future self:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>this deck is bad.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>The concept doesn't work, if you use stimhack early to install things, then you end up with no creds and no cards forcing you to rebuild for several turns.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>I almost never play the console, i already have trouble scrubbing together credits for programs, let alone a console.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Public sympathy is quite nice, it seems better than I expected, with pro con you like to draw and this lets you take more advantage of it, while also protecting against scorch and net damage and buffering some of the stim hack brain damage.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Personal workshop hasn't worked well, modded would be better.  I rarely get more than 3 or 4 credits out of it.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Cloak and dagger are weird, with the 3 test run and 3 smc, it's not hard to get the pair out, but what I didn't realize until I played it, is that even then, you are in danger with layered ice since cloak only gives you 1 credit per turn to use.   I am wondering if some ice destruction might be in order to support it properly.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Decoy with public sympathy is good against weyland, but against NBN midseason tagging, this deck may have serious problems, haven't tried yet though.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>What really seems to be missing is some Econ in the early game, this deck seriously suffers from having too many cards that take a while to be good but needing an up front investment.<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","username":"Garbo","cards":{"01004":3,"01007":2,"01032":2,"01037":2,"01038":2,"01043":1,"01044":1,"01050":3,"02002":2,"02046":1,"02047":3,"02049":3,"02050":2,"02107":3,"03041":3,"03042":2,"03046":3,"03049":3}},{"id":1150,"name":"My ice is too expensive.","creation":"2013-12-29 03:37:21","description":"<p>Big ice, big problems.<\/p>\n","username":"Eris_Another","cards":{"01054":1,"01055":2,"01056":2,"01057":1,"01058":2,"01061":1,"01062":2,"01063":2,"01064":2,"01069":1,"01070":1,"01075":2,"01098":2,"01106":3,"01108":2,"01109":2,"01110":3,"01111":1,"02011":2,"02012":2,"02110":3,"02117":2,"03007":2,"03009":1,"03013":2,"03015":1,"03026":2,"03027":1}},{"id":1152,"name":"Chess is Hard v0.1","creation":"2013-12-29 10:13:50","description":"<p>WANT FEEDBACK PLEASE<\/p>\n\n<p>So I was itching to make a 'Chess Deck'.<\/p>\n\n<p>The aim for the deck is to make it costly to ress ICE and when ressed lower it so I can break through with cheap ICEBreakers.<\/p>\n\n<p>Make it Expensive:\nReina, Rook and Xanadu<\/p>\n\n<p>Make it Weak:\nDatasucker, Bishop and Ice Carver<\/p>\n\n<p>Make it Trash:\nDemolition Run and Imp stacked with Medium<\/p>\n\n<p>Removed cards from initial theoretical build:\n1x Demolition Run<\/p>\n\n<p>1x Emergenzy Shutdown<\/p>\n\n<p>1x Scheherazade\n1x Knight\n1x Imp\n1x Clone Chip - Not room for 3?\n1x Djinn - Odd one out\n2x Pawn - Clone Chip can do its job\n3x Liberated Account - Too expensive\n3x Retrieval Run<\/p>\n","username":"paintner","cards":{"01002":3,"01003":1,"01007":2,"01008":3,"01010":2,"01011":2,"01012":2,"01014":2,"01015":2,"01050":3,"01053":3,"02003":2,"02009":2,"02043":2,"02082":2,"03038":2,"04003":3,"04021":2,"04022":1,"04041":1,"04042":2,"04043":2}},{"id":1153,"name":"Fox News (Your Source for Evil)","creation":"2013-12-29 12:52:10","description":"<p>get money and then wreck the runners day by either psychographic victory or SE destruction.

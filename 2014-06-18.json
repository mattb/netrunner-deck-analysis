Asset economy and lots of strong ICE that has lots of subs  is terrible to fight against with crypsis, and unless the turn 1 draw consisted of Imps and Siphons that you could land then the game rapidly dissolved as every server was protected by 3 ICE. Eli as an example is 3 to rez and either 4 or 6 for the basic deck to break. Most HB ICE is just too expensive for anarch economy to get through even semi-regularly.<\/p>\n\n<p>Thus I reworked the deck. The biggest changes have been dropping Siphons and the DLR Josh B combo. At least 1 Siphon had to go to make room for the desperately needed e3s (which also work with knight against non HB). I decided that 1 Siphon with 2 planned assaults freed up influence but meant that the ability to get to Siphon early was not actually compromised. 3 cards in the deck still lead to siphon, although yes once you have it there is technically slightly less chance of repeating it given that the other planned assault can now no longer lead to siphon. I know this makes the deck slightly weaker vs other opponents, but I hope it gives it overall a little more consistency and variation now that stimhack and vamp are floating around.<\/p>\n\n<p>Having the planned assaults also meant needing a few more run events, so 1 stimhack and 1 vamp were added, meaning that planned assault can get you what you need at the time. The continuing SoTs and D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vus mean you can still potentially land 7 siphons, which is enough in a single game. I know that this change has made the deck slightly weaker vs other opponents, but I consider it necessary to make the deck viable against HB.<\/p>\n\n<p>I took out the DLR Josh B combo because I felt it was 5 cards spent on a 'win harder' scenario. When ahead throwing the combo down does horrible things to the corp, but when behind it doesn't really help in any way. also I found I was probably only using it once a game on average before ti was trashed, and this just doesn't seem worth 5 card slots.<\/p>\n\n<p>Given the liberated accounts and tag me nature of the deck I am assuming they will be used in an 'install, take 12' type scenario.<\/p>\n\n<p>Any thoughts are welcome!<\/p>\n","username":"frost-duty","cards":{"01001":1,"01002":3,"01004":1,"01006":2,"01008":2,"01009":2,"01010":1,"01012":3,"01018":1,"01050":3,"01051":3,"01053":2,"02003":2,"02009":2,"02021":1,"02022":2,"02024":2,"03054":3,"04005":3,"04043":3,"04061":2,"05036":2}},{"id":6903,"name":"Programme Hell: Upstalk Edition","creation":"2014-06-18 08:48:09","description":"<p>It's back, and this time . . . it's personal.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Testimonials:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>\"I didn't think this deck was very good when I first saw it, but then I said to myself: \"Self, I think we should try this deck out.\" and ever since then: I've won all of my netrunner games, I've grown a fuller, thicker head of hair, and I am in a constant state of arousal.

Try to get out your econ assets out as fast as possible, protecting them or not is a call on who you're playing. It is good to lightly protect Sundews. Ideally, I liked to have some type of ETR ICE as the innermost ICE protecting centrals with something they'll HAVE to pay for as the outermost. You don't want them just running into your server for free, only to jack out &amp; run the remotes.

With archer rezzed on a remote, you almost certainly trashed at least 1 breaker, and you now have a server they can only run once every 3 turns, making your headfakes absolutely brutal. <\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Ash:  Everytime i played ash I either drew an inside job that left the runner with not enough credits to score, or it not only scored me an agenda, but usually the runner couldn't trash it the first time they accessed it.  If only I could run 3, haha. <\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Shipment from Sansan:  Its better than beanstalk in that it doesnt cost influence (enabling the Ash play) and saves you clicks otherwise spent solely on econ.  Being able to sansan out agendas means that account siphon doesnt wreck you as much, whereas beanstalk in hand wont let you score an installed agenda the turn after a siphon.  Being able to score an agenda for free to win the game occurred pretty often - when runners get sick of running your remote and being forced to trash ash, sansan city grid, and jackson, econ denial normally can still let them stop you from scoring.  Not so with Shipment from SanSan. <\/p><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>Changes I want:  I am going to try beanstalk over GLC, but I'm not sure thats a good idea. The economy for this deck is tight, but sufficient. <\/p>\n\n<p>ICE: Wall of static is horrible.  I could see those being Paper wall once mala tempora is out.  For now, i might drop them for 1 enigma 1 jackson howard.<\/p>\n\n<p>AGENDAS: I'd like to run a third Breaking news, but dont know what to drop for it.

This deck is what happened with it after 3 data packs of changing it to suit me more ;). The goal of the deck is to quickly create a remote that forces the runner to use at least two icebreakers.

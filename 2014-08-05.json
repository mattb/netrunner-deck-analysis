He makes running more interesting, which is always good.<\/p>\n\n<p>Notable Inclusions:\nThe Personal Touch: Boy did I ever underestimate this card. It is truly amazing and saves you a ton of money over the long game.<\/p>\n\n<p>Pipleline: Never thought I'd be using this breaker. But it's been strong, killing sentries like nobody's business. Run into a strength 2 and throw a Personal Touch on it. Or just Femme larger sentries.<\/p>\n\n<p>Motivation\/Oracle May - Another random thing I never thought I'd include in a deck, but it turns out to be quite the amazing draw\/econ engine. I'm a big fan.<\/p>\n\n<p>Parasite - Strictly in here for Chimera. Chimera single-handedly shuts the deck down, so it's a must-include unfortunately. SMCs are in here to tutor it up, and Clone Chip gets it back. Plus it has the added benefit of just being a good program to kill weak ice with.<\/p>\n\n<p>Personal Workshop - This is probably obvious to most, but it's just a great econ engine that works well with Nasir's on-the-fly credits. A great include. Though I'm thinking of going to 2.<\/p>\n\n<p>Other Notes: I have had great success with the deck, but it has required constant refinement over the course of it's existence. I may be getting a little greedy with the 2 Legworks. I think trading them for more Stimhacks and a Corroder may be in order. Tell me what you think!<\/p>\n","username":"coyotemoon722","cards":{"01004":1,"01007":1,"01012":2,"01026":1,"01040":3,"01043":2,"01046":2,"01050":2,"02009":2,"02027":1,"02049":3,"02066":1,"02087":3,"02091":2,"02106":3,"02107":2,"03038":2,"03046":3,"03053":2,"04008":2,"05035":2,"05054":3,"06017":1}},{"id":8269,"name":"NEH Tag\/Horizontal","creation":"2014-08-05 03:04:05","description":"\n","username":"Axlotl","cards":{"01060":1,"01081":3,"01082":3,"01084":3,"01088":2,"01090":2,"01092":2,"01101":2,"01104":2,"01107":1,"01109":3,"02016":1,"02029":3,"02040":2,"02055":2,"02056":3,"04015":3,"04055":2,"04096":3,"04119":3,"05009":3,"06005":1}},{"id":8273,"name":"Tennin Reviewed","creation":"2014-08-05 05:27:58","description":"<p>Not my decklist, adapted one.

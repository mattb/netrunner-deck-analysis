It has a strong late game, consisting of highly expensive-to-run central servers and the ability to chain score agendas out of hand, as well as loads of recursion to grab combo pieces as you need them, but the first several turns tend to be pretty weak.<\/p>\n\n<p>The general strategy with this deck is to always be drawing, playing operations for econ, layering your defense to the point that it becomes taxing to run through (usually 2-3 ice deep), or scoring out of hand when the opportunity presents itself. Ideally, the first agenda scored will be an Efficiency Committee, which you can then leverage into scoring your 3\/2 (install, advance, use committee token, advance twice using SanSan) or Mandatory Upgrades (Biotic Labor, install, advance x 2, use all 3 committee tokens, advance 4 times with a pair of SanSan shipments). If the requisite 2 biotic labor haven't shown up during an appropriate turn, but you do have 1 biotic labor and a shipment, using them to score a 3\/2 agenda out of hand makes a lot of sense, especially if you then use Archived Memories or Jackson to put those combo parts back into play.<\/p>\n\n<p>The ICE is intended to be both taxing and cost-effective, and so I have prioritized multiple sub ICE, as well as keeping most of my code gates strictly above 3 str. Minelayer is the only bit of ice that doesn't have multiple subs, but since he is the HB equivalent of Chum (rez for 1, break his sub or he'll make things more difficult for you in the future), he is still quite taxing for his cost. The pair of Wotan are meant to be paired with the Bioroid Efficiency Research and seated in front of HQ, which allow me to trade 3 coins in rez cost for either a big install plus 4 credit per run tax (femme) or a one time 12 credit burst (corroder), after which I'll usually use Archived Memories -> BER to rez the Wotan again.<\/p>\n\n<p>The biggest problems this deck faces are Vamping decks and highly aggressive Atman decks. Neither has been very common of late, and even stopping Atman is only somewhat harder than usual, but those Vamp decks absolutely wreck me.

The counter is an at-will no click net damage, that's already huge, but even if they you dont even own a counter in the whole game, Snoop still shines thanks to its on encounter power, seeing the hand of the runner is a great way to both control their plays and not falling into traps like discovering a powerful out of faction card before it's too late and counter them preemptively (eg : Account Siphon, Vamp, Stimhack, Inside Job).<\/p>\n\n<p>You also know how many events and ressources they got and that set you up for a second unexpected flatline victory if they have no programs nor harware in their grip : Invasion of Privacy + a Neural EMP.<\/p>\n\n<p>Even without outright killing them, knowledge is power, say after a Snoop you discover their hand is full of very good cards or have a critical Icebreaker, you can settle them down by discarding their advantage with a couple Neural EMP because you what, their will be always a Jackson to take them back.<\/p>\n\n<p>Snare is two-fold, it setts you up for a kill, and they also play  a part in your defensive game plan. As you noticed there are fewer ICEs than ordinarily expected but they tend to be quite expensive, hence the asset based drip economy, the deck is played as the well knonw Never Advance archetype which is really at home here, the runners could really feel secure trashing all your assets and of course Sansan and dont mind ending their turns whith so few credits as long as they have 4 cards in hand and maybe a plascrete, after all you wont close the accounts of a really poor runner, that's when Invasion of privacy hurt them the must, and you can also Jackson them again, the Snares too by the way.<\/p>\n\n<p>Oh but how do you win if all your Sansan and Jackson are trashed, the latersfrom R&amp;D when you dont even have seen them and so you cant reycle cards, well just send the Interns that's their job to put back a key asset back in the game, and that parasited Tollbooth that no longer protect you from a R&amp;D Lock, they can also put it back on top of your server, for free.<\/p>\n\n<p>All in all it's pretty awesome to play, you dont have much tag punishement but that actually plays in your favor, remember when you hit a snare in the second to last action and you have only 1 card in hand and now a tag ? What do you do against NBN and Weyland, you remove the tag, what you should do against Jinteki ? Drawing a card, for the same reason Scorched Earth can wreck a runner in a Jinteki deck, EMP will wreck runners in this decks because they fear tags from NBN, that or they play reckless tag me decks who dont like to pay for traces and so will dont dont bother Snoop until it is too late.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now a little less enthusiasm, the ICEs are very porous at first, you want more an early Snoop in front of R&amp;D (or HQ for criminals) that a plain old end the run, and of course they can win games by drawing all agendas before you're even ready to retaliate. On the other hand you can also have a lucky string of agendas with chain scoring Astroscript and Breaking News, Restrutured Datapool is either scored really early or is not scored at all, is main purpose is to tone down agenda density a bit because either way you will have a hard time scoring either 3 1-pointers or 2 Character Assassination\/PSF, dump it as soon as possible against a runner aggressively running your HQ, again it's easier than dumping 2 unwelcomed agendas.<\/p>\n\n<p>So now show runners the power of a Chaotic Evil Google Deck and feel free to comment and\/or improve the ICEs and Agendas set up.<\/p>\n","username":"Mash","cards":{"01070":3,"01072":3,"01075":1,"01080":1,"01081":3,"01082":3,"01090":2,"01092":2,"01109":3,"01110":3,"01113":2,"02016":1,"02019":1,"02055":2,"02056":2,"02059":2,"02080":2,"02115":3,"03026":1,"04015":3,"04016":2,"04056":3,"04060":2}},{"id":1057,"name":"NBN - hope for tags (large deck)","creation":"2013-12-20 18:12:33","description":"\n","username":"somndev","cards":{"01075":2,"01080":1,"01081":3,"01082":2,"01084":2,"01085":2,"01088":3,"01090":2,"01092":3,"01104":2,"01107":1,"01108":2,"01110":3,"02013":1,"02019":3,"02020":3,"02055":3,"02110":3,"02115":3,"03026":2,"03027":2,"04014":3,"04015":2,"04055":2}},{"id":1061,"name":"I double dog dare you - Jinteki ALWAYS advance","creation":"2013-12-20 19:33:52","description":"<p>This is my attempt at Jinteki Fast advance in the future. <\/p>\n\n<p>Basically, abuse Mushin No Shin.

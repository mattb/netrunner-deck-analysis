All you other runners can't deny.<br \/>\nWith apologies to Sir Mix A Lot.<\/p>\n\n<p>This is the latest version of my big breakers deck. This deck tends to run over anything the Corp drops. Morningstar shreds any barrier under Heimdall, even the dreaded Hive. With a dinosaurus it even gets past either Heimdall. Torch gets past the new, nastier code gates like Inazuma. I finally went with 3 Femme. We all know how awesome Femme is already so I'll just mention she's my Mother Goddess bypass until more ICE are rezzed since I don't have an AI breaker.\nData dealer is great to threaten the Corp with. The possibility of forfeiting a 1 point agenda for a legwork access or an RID run or two which may net you more, or game, points is very nice. If the Corp is playing Shi Kyu, even better. Eventually Domestic Sleepers will be another option. \nInfiltrate because traps are coming back and it's nice to know whether to waste time going down a big server or not. Other than that, spam test run\/scavenge. Don't be afraid to use Modded if the breaker you need is in your hand. The money you save long term from any of your breakers makes up for not getting a TR\/Scavenge discount. \nMagnus Opus is still my favorite economy card. The pressure an MO puts on the Corp is priceless. I don't run plascrete because Scorch isn't common in my meta and this deck can handle runs and still have money to fight traces with the cheapness of breaking. \nDues X because Jinteki. Nice against those brutal shock archive runs as well as the occasional Janus\/Ichi\/etc. \nConstructive thoughts are always welcome.

Chimera is an excellent Early game ICE for scoring that first astro. After that, fast track into the next one, etc. Even if an astro is stolen, you can use Ash to score an NAPD contract or a Beale. You may even be able to over advance the Beale if the runner is poor enough from trashing marked accounts or running in general. That's why I have 3 NAPD and only 2 Beale. The NAPD is far more important in conjunction with Ash and even more so if a runner made the mistake of going poor trashing Marked Accounts last turn. Rainbow is an underrated ICE imo. It's expensive to break even if it can be broken by any breaker. Viper\/Cadeucus are the obligatory trace ICE, although I'm still excited to see whatever Jinteki gives us for their \"snake\" trace ICE.  The deck is pretty heavy on ICE so we can get everything ICE'd up quick and start scoring.  This deck has no real end game ICE other than two Tollbooth, so be aggressive. The sweeps week and hedge funds should give you enough economy to start and Gila\/marked accounts\/Caduceus\/pop up should keep it going enough to let you score. \nAny constructive criticism is welcome.

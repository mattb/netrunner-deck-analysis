It also means placing layer after layer, to make it extremely expensive to run on.<br><br>Why having to protect heavily HQ is also an advantage?<br>Well if it costs tons of credits to go for it, every Agenda you hold in your hands will be safer. Plus many nasty cards require them to run on HQ (Emergency Shutdown for example). Finally, Escher isn't much of a weapon when you basically just have a huge vertical server, a remote that might not even have any ICE on it, and possibly few on R&D \/ Archives.<br><br>Sunset, then, is clearly here to pu Cell Portal, at the bottom of HQ. It is an hardly expected ICE, and when it's behind, say, an Hadrian's Wall, a Tollbooth and a Swarm with some advancements, it might be troublesome (also kinda wrecks Yogasaurus decks). You should obviously put the most dangerous ICE up front, so it'll hurt even more to start from scratch again.<br><br>You need money to do all this, so the Agenda selection works towards that, and there's all the Transactions you can get without influence. Plus Oversight AI, which can add the extra ICE that your HQ needs.<br><br>Finally, unless I'm missing something, you could always install two copies of Off the Grid on the Agenda-scoring remote: one rezzed immediately to block the Runner, the other just in case they reach HQ and trash the first.

I feel being able to recall the 3x Snare (or any operation), as well as being able to mess with Indexing \/ R&D lock is too good of a tool to pass up in favour of increasing the draw speed. <br><br>I've swapped out the 1x Government Contracts for 1x The Cleaners, but I don't think this change is anything new. I assume Supermodernism v2.1 will do this change as well. If scored, The Cleaners allows you to 2x Scorched Earth a runner through 1x Plascrete Carapace. <br><br>I am debating dropping down to SEA Source to 1x. With Atlas, I have never found myself needing a second SEA Source to secure a flatline win. This would open up 2 influence points for many interesting cards, such as: <br><br>Neural Katana - I really like this as a facecheck punisher. Place in front of R&D and the runner dies to this and Snare. <br><br>Ichi 1.0 - Another form of program trashing to punish low program redundancy runners (mostly criminals). The trace is acceptable since we should be able to afford to make it land with Weyland's economy, and the Tag + Brain Damage really fit in to our second win condition. <br><br>Aggressive Secretary - Another form of program trashing to punish low program redundancy runners (mostly criminals). Even if this gets trashed from R&D, the runner may now believe that you are running traps and be wary of any advanced card. <br><br>Red Herrings, Ash, and Bernice Mai - Standard agenda protection upgrades and another bluff tool to make the runner run through your server to get a SEA Source off. The low trash cost and general strategy of this deck (hard ETR ice) make this less appealing. <br><br>Neural EMP - Probably not worth it as a 1x. <br><br>I will playtest both Neural Katana and Aggressive Secretary.","username":"lopert","cards":{"01070":3,"01086":2,"01093":1,"01094":3,"01098":3,"01099":3,"01101":3,"01103":3,"01110":3,"01111":3,"01113":2,"02018":3,"02060":2,"02070":3,"02080":2,"03026":2,"04015":2,"04017":3,"04020":3,"04036":1}},{"id":424,"name":"Haas-Bioroid - Version 1.1","creation":"2013-11-07 10:23:36","description":"Limited to 1 core set only.

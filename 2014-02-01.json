[{"id":1879,"name":"Crypsis: The Ladies Man","creation":"2014-02-01 02:39:06","description":"<p>Something I'd been wanting to try for some time now, a deck that uses Crypsis as the only real icebreaker. Here Crypsis gets his girls together for some good running times. Get him out on an omni-drive, then pimp him up with personal touch, cyber feeder. Other important ladies: Katie Jones, Sure Gamble, Femme and Kate herself.<\/p>\n\n<p>This deck isn't an early aggro deck unless you see a fast adv coming. You can take a few turns building your Cryp rig, making annoying quick runs here and there. When you see remotes drop, use infiltration to determine whether or not to Stimhack or Katie dump and go running with Cryp. Sacrificial construct is awesome in this deck, as it can keep Cryp going for an extra ice or save him from pesky destroyers. Test run Femme when you see the need and use the appropriate tricks (keyhole, sneakdoor, sharpshooter) to keep the corp honest. No small ETR ice are going to stop you early, and late game you'll have so much cash that Cryp can just pay his way through. It's beautiful.<\/p>\n\n<p>Also, Escher might get the 6th man award here for setting up those mid- to late-game servers just the way you want them. Entire turns dedicated to cryp counter, katie load, hardware install and draw are frequent and necessary. Timing is everything with this deck, make sure you know a turn in advance if you will be running the next turn.<\/p>\n\n<p>This deck has been through some testing and a few versions, but seems to be playing quite well now. I may drop 1 underworld contact and 1 stimhack...that's too many dudes blocking Crypsis' game. Earlier versions had surge, scavenge, borrowed satellites...but they left me wanting. Now I rarely draw a card I'm not happy to have.<\/p>\n\n<p>You might notice there are quite a few one- and two-of cards. Thanks to replicator and test run, you'll thin this deck out quickly and will have what you need most of the time. That is also why the deck is above 45. Against Jinteki net damage deck I won a grind out game because I had those extra six cards in my stack and could keep refilling my hand late-game.<\/p>\n\n<p>Fun deck to play that has flexibility for some influence-high tricks. Sneak and Keyhole here, but siphons and other pests can be just as flavorful and just as dangerous.<\/p>\n\n<p>Crypsis loves the ladies... <\/p>\n","username":"Heartthrob","cards":{"01004":3,"01005":3,"01026":1,"01028":1,"01033":1,"01039":2,"01040":3,"01044":2,"01048":3,"01049":3,"01050":3,"01051":3,"02002":1,"02009":2,"02047":3,"02069":3,"02087":1,"02088":2,"02091":2,"03031":3,"03039":2,"03053":2,"04061":1,"04067":2}},{"id":1880,"name":"Weyland ICE Storm Big Money No Problems","creation":"2014-02-01 07:57:07","description":"<p>Just a little concept, 9 Agendas (Could be playng 7 or 8, but Hostile is too good), 20 ICE and a lot of money.\nThe main strategy is play slow, don't draw more cards, just get money.\nIs the runner trying to R&amp;D lock you?

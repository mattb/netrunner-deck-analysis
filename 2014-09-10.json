I think Ichi 2.0 could be the winning splash in this deck so long as its out before D4v1d. If I see the Big D being too prevalent I'll swap it out for a 1.0 and maybe another Eli.<\/p>\n\n<hr \/>\n\n<p>v1.1: Closed accounts is down to 1 to free up influence for a second Lotus Field. I needed more hard ETR ice that isn't in D4v1d range, and besides, you can always just tutor for the CA with an Atlas token if you absolutely have to. Chimera is also out to make room for two copies of Interns to bring back either of the two grids in a pinch.<\/p>\n\n<hr \/>\n\n<p>The ice is nastier. The Oversight AI is real. The Scorch is a mercy.<\/p>\n\n<p>This version of Blue Sun has teeth, and it relies on OAI as raw fuel for its economic engine. Pop it on your costly pieces of ice-- Curtain Wall, Janus, Tollbooth if you must though that isn't preferable -- and call them back to get free money. Fly your two Data Ravens to whichever server needs protecting, but plan on keeping at least one over HQ if you have a Crisium Grid installed. That's because once you build up your taxing fortress servers, just one simple Closed Accounts is all it takes to shut the runner out. And scoring the Eden Fragment almost makes this deck laughably good.<\/p>\n\n<p>Plan on having a heavily stacked HQ because once Crisium Grid gets online behind an ice fortress there, accessing the remote in which you've loaded Off The Grid becomes an absolute bear. Trashing OTG will require two successful runs on HQ with an additional tax of 5c to trash the Crisium on the first run. That means with even one Data Raven and a Crisium on HQ they can't make the runs to clear Off The Grid and access your remote without clearing the two tags they rack up. Then you either dropped a Closed Accounts to lock them out of your servers on future runs, or they need to hope you don't have the double Scorched in hand.<\/p>\n\n<p>I've debated either swapping the Tollbooth for a third Data Raven, or actually dropping the Closed Accounts for another Lotus Field + another Wall of Thorns, but I think for now this is how the deck will stay.<\/p>\n\n<p>I'd love to hear your thoughts.<\/p>\n","username":"BTrain","cards":{"01088":2,"01090":1,"01098":3,"01099":2,"01101":2,"01106":2,"01110":3,"02018":1,"02019":2,"02079":3,"02110":2,"03017":1,"03027":2,"04015":2,"04036":1,"04038":3,"04060":2,"04078":2,"04117":2,"04119":3,"05024":2,"06003":2,"06030":1,"06048":3,"06068":1}},{"id":9439,"name":"Nasir Meidan - The Space Rogue v 0.5","creation":"2014-09-10 08:11:21","description":"<p>So this is the alpha version of a deck, which I really want to try out. As of now I still don't have my hands on the cards in the 3rd data pack, so no testing can be done. <\/p>\n\n<p>I think the general idea is pretty obvious, here is what is different though:<\/p>\n\n<p>1) you use <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01041\">The Toolbox<\/a> for extra recurring credits.<\/p>\n\n<p>2) you use Nasir's ability and Personal Workshop to push out heavy stuff early games ( let alone if the opponent is playing some Bad Pub cards lol)<\/p>\n\n<p>3) Once you setup  everything through mid game, you should be able to break in anywhere with the recurring credits and the efficiency of the Stealth Breakers<\/p>\n\n<p>4) Cyber Solutions Mem chip instead of Akematsu, because they will be easier to install via Personal Workshop than normally and because you would need minimum 6 memory for 3x Cloak + 3x Breakers let alone Imp and Cache <\/p>\n\n<p>Things that I'm thinking about:<\/p>\n\n<p>1) get Legwork and 3x SoT to put HQ pressure in late game ( I have this in my \"normal\" recurring credits Nasir and it won me a couple of games already). However to do this, I need to thin out some spaces ( maybe an Aesop or  Cyber Solutions Mem chip), which is impossible without some play testing.  Maybe put in a Nerve Agent If I can't thin out.<\/p>\n\n<p>2) Not sure if Imp will pay off. The General idea is that many people allow Nassir early game to run free and on many occasions in my games so far I really wished I had an imp in my deck to punish them even harder in those early \"free\" runs.   However, I also found out that Parasite is great in Nasir as well as data-sucker, so maybe they will replace the Imp. <\/p>\n\n<p>3) Another idea is Keyhole. However, I feel it has a counter-efficiency with a deck that runs Indexing <strong>and<\/strong> R&amp;D interface... <\/p>\n\n<p>As always, if you have any questions and comments, go ahead =)<\/p>\n\n<p>P.s.

That could be said of about any kind of deck, but I think it's much more relevant in Jinteki, given how every player reacts differently to traps: some are <em>brave<\/em> and face check everything, others are more <em>cautious<\/em> and take baby steps, while others try to set up defenses before their <em>offensive<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n<p>It can also be an advantage precisely because your opponent will hardly know what to expect and how to approach the game, especially in the early phases. Having plenty of different advanceable cards and Assets, as well as having a wide variety of ice, helps making things even more chaotic.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now, about the Agenda selection:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"\/en\/card\/06049\">Chronos Project<\/a> is the big news from <strong>First Contact<\/strong>, and as many already guessed, it's a (very) welcome novelty for <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01067\">Jinteki: PE<\/a>. Against a deck full of Net Damage, losing your <em>Heap<\/em> means losing the ability to <em>heal<\/em> yourself and recover your <em>life points<\/em>.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"\/en\/card\/02032\">Fetal AI<\/a> is an obvious choice, and can also be the one way to win by agenda points. If your opponent is at the end of his deck, with few cards left in hand he can be either too wary to try and steal a card with already 2 advancements on it, or just totally unable to survive stealing it. In the long run, this card can be your best friend.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"\/en\/card\/03023\">Gila Hands Arcology<\/a> is basically the main economy of this deck. In more than one game I scored this over an  <a href=\"\/en\/card\/05004\">House of Knives<\/a>, and the decision proved to be correct, paving the way for my victory. The deck doesn't need much money, but it still needs enough to pay for <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01070\">Snare!<\/a> or <a href=\"\/en\/card\/03009\">Cerebral Overwriter<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"\/en\/card\/05004\">House of Knives<\/a> is easily the contender for the title of key card of the deck. If you aim to kill, scoring two of these can immensely facilitate that goal. Unless you already have one scored, though, <a href=\"\/en\/card\/03023\">GHA<\/a> should be favored over this.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"\/en\/card\/05007\">The Future Perfect<\/a> serves to fill in the remaining points without needing another excessive number of agenda. It's unreliable, but can prove difficult to steal, so it's definitely better than the other options (even the new neutrals). Most of the time you'll be discarding it as soon as <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04015\">Jackson Howard<\/a> comes around.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Assets are the thing that makes this deck work, and they all serve a very important function:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"\/en\/card\/03009\">Cerebral Overwriter<\/a> is a beast, and with the almost complete lack of defenses against Brain Damage, this one should be the target of your <a href=\"\/en\/card\/05015\">Mushin No Shin<\/a> as soon as you get one. Scoring some BD on the Runner in early games is basically a game over.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"\/en\/card\/04099\">GRNDL Refinery<\/a> is another good target for <a href=\"\/en\/card\/05015\">Mushin<\/a> when you're low on money, otherwise just advance it behind some ice (possibly <a href=\"\/en\/card\/06043\">Kitsune<\/a>. When most of your advanced cards are traps, they'll think twice before checking one, at least until they see you got this one too.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"\/en\/card\/04015\">Jackson Howard<\/a> is <strong>essential<\/strong>, no alternatives. You need to be able to recycle stuff from the Archives, and especially to safely discard some Agenda when flooded.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"\/en\/card\/01069\">Project Junebug<\/a> is another killer, considering it amounts to 6 Net Damage when powered by <a href=\"\/en\/card\/05015\">Mushin<\/a>. That makes it another very good option to store some advancement tokens to be later used with <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02033\">Trick of Light<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"\/en\/card\/04073\">Shock!<\/a> works wonders in this deck. Even one in Archives is usually enough to stop their runs there, and when you have 2 or 3 the extra ND might kill them, or anyway accelerate  their demise. To be discarded as soon as possible.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"\/en\/card\/01070\">Snare!<\/a> continues to be the biggest danger for runners, even with 2 deluxes and 2 full cycles of data packs. As one friend said: <em>\"there's just nothing else so scary\"<\/em>. Efficient and fairly expensive, always keep enough money to use it. Even when that means scoring an Agenda one turn later, or two.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>The other two keys of the deck would be <a href=\"\/en\/card\/05015\">Mushin No Shin<\/a> which is essentially your way to get free advancement tokens, and might actually be enough to kill a runner. <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02033\">Trick of Light<\/a> is what you need to score <a href=\"\/en\/card\/03023\">Gila<\/a> and\/or <a href=\"\/en\/card\/05004\">House of Knives<\/a> without any problems.<\/p>\n\n<p>I hardly ever won by scoring 7 agenda point with this deck, but I can consistently kill my opponent. It does take quite a long time to do so, however, so the deck might not be the best option in a tournament.<\/p>\n\n<p>It's very fun to play though, and with the new addition of <a href=\"\/en\/card\/06043\">Kitsune<\/a>, it's even better.<\/p>\n\n<p>By the way, in ancient japan the \u72d0 (kitsune, fox) was considered to be the true form of a bakemono, a shapeshifting monster.

For starters, I reverted back to Making News because Near Earth Hub just didn't support the ICE I needed to make the deck successful. I got rid of a few pieces of unnecessary ICE like Hunter and added some new favorites like Shadow and an additional Information Overload. Flare made its way back in because I needed an ICE that could do some serious damage if the Runner is unprepared. I added some previous Econ favorites back in along with Targeted Marketing because it's stupidly good against predictable and popular decks. Also new to the deck is Hive, making its debut. In recent matches, I've found that I could easily leave Hive with three or two ETR subroutines and then PsychoBeale for game, so I'm giving it a whirl temporarily. <\/p>\n\n<p>Things I might change: Flare, because the 9 rez cost is brutal.  Might add in a copy of Matrix Analyzer instead to have more tagging potential. I also might try and add more econ somehow, maybe Restructure or Successful Demonstration (since anyone who runs into a Data Raven early on ends the run to avoid bad stuff). <\/p>\n\n<p>Always looking for more feedback, so feel free to comment!<\/p>\n","username":"WardOfTheWoods","cards":{"01080":1,"01081":3,"01084":1,"01085":2,"01088":3,"01090":1,"01099":2,"01104":1,"01110":3,"02016":1,"02017":2,"02055":2,"02056":3,"02115":3,"02116":2,"02117":1,"04015":3,"04076":3,"04095":3,"04096":1,"04117":2,"06003":2,"06026":3,"06027":2}},{"id":9458,"name":"SHIRKA : v0.2","creation":"2014-09-10 19:42:01","description":"<p>\"Ulysses, the way back to earth has been wiped from my memory\"<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"\/en\/card\/02047\">Test Run<\/a> = Two uses from an <a href=\"\/en\/card\/05053\">Overmind<\/a> also hopefully ensuring it comes out when you want it to maximise memory usage.<\/p>\n\n<p>Tempted by the idea of a <a href=\"\/en\/card\/03038\">Clone Chip<\/a> to refresh the Overmind mid run if needed...

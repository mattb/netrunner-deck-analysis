And by lategame, with plenty of Silencer\/Cloak support even the biggest of sentries barely slow down runs.<\/p>\n\n<p>And as per the original design, getting Paintbrush out allows Dagger to take care of other ice too. However, the Atmans,  Parasite and Snowball take care of most non-sentry ice anyway, so Paintbrush is not a necessity.

As per most current NBN decks, it wins by scoring agendas faster than the runner can get set up.<\/p>\n\n<p>However, I decided to take advantage of NBN's reputation for typically running fairly passive harmless ice that can be safely face-checked, and packed in a variety of nasty sentries to interrupt the runner's plans and make them lose balance if they hit them without a killer.<\/p>\n\n<p>So, whenever you draw the right cards to pursue a fast-advance strategy to Agenda-Point win, scoring those Agendas is first priority.<\/p>\n\n<p>But in the meantime, slow the runner down and disrupt them with unexpected twists to confuse them as to whether the deck aims to FA or is doing something else:\n- try to get them to facecheck Neural Katana naked to lose some cards\n- Use Snoop to blow up breakers or nasty events whenever possible\n- put Chum in front of Neural Katana and a Corp Troubleshooter in root if you think they might run intending to leave chum and break Neural Katana, so you might get a kill.\n- put Chum in front of Snoop or Flare to force them to break the brutal ice str rather than fight the trace (also makes the Snoop &amp; Flare 8 strength which is out of Knight range)\n- Use Corp Troubleshooter with Rototurret or Grim any chance you get to blow up a breaker - especially code gate breakers as there is a lot of EtR code gates and many runners are light on decoders\n- put Chum in front of chimera as a cheap way to stop the runner from taxing you by running chimera<\/p>\n\n<p>The economy of the deck is 3x Hedge, 3x Sweeps, and 2x Private Contracts. The Sweeps were great as with the net damage flying around, runners didn't dare reduce hand size to combat it. The Private Contracts were a great source of money as the deck often wants to click for credits here and there, and no runner ever dared trash it as they needed their credits for elsewhere.<\/p>\n\n<p>In practice, I found the Neural Katanas very effective for throwing runners off balance, but little use after that, often being broken or bypassed for a single credit. The Chums and Quandarys were both good, but I found myself wishing for Enigma instead of Quandary as Chum puts it up to 4 strength while only pumping Quandary to a useless 2 str.<\/p>\n\n<p>The Rototurrets did good work all day, regularly trashing a breaker on rez and also often a second breaker with the help of a Corp Troubleshooter (against Mimic, Atman, or Femme Fatale with limited credits).<\/p>\n\n<p>Flare, Grim ,Caduceus, Wraparound and Tollbooth all did well in their jobs of forcing out breakers or taxing the runner.<\/p>\n\n<p>Snoop and Chimera did not help much however, I think in future they might be replaced by RSVP and Wall of Static respectively.<\/p>\n\n<p>(What's the name about?

She's a 40 card\nCriminal deck which by itself intrigues me.<\/p>\n\n<p>Blackguard\/Cortez Chip\/Forged Activation Orders:  So the idea here is that if you use\ncortez chip on something then expose it, Blackguard will either force them to pay an extra\n2 bucks or admit that they can't rez it.  If they do the latter and you have a FAO in hand\nyou can happily force them to trash that ice.  If you don't, you can still confidently \nrun knowing that ICE wont' rez.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Hostage: This is here to get Kati\/Pro Contacts\/Tri-Maf out.  I want to love Tri-Maf but \nI think it might be bad.  1 use per turn is not so great and I can't help but expect that\nit's got a huge TRASH ME sign on it for anyone playing with Breaking News.  (Hence Fall\nGuy).<\/p>\n\n<p>Econ: Infiltration should probably be used for expose.  I feel like if you have Kati and\nTri-maf out, you could do ok money-wise.  IDK about Pro Contacts in this deck.  Might be \nbad.  Fall Guy is really there to keep your Tri-maf from dying but if you don't feel like\nyou need it (or you feel pretty safe behind a plascrete or two) then maybe he's best used\nfor the 2 bucks.  Moddeds are in to help alleviate the ridiculous price of Blackguard and\ncan help with breakers, R&amp;D-I's, and Plascrete's too.  Not sure about having 3 though.<\/p>\n\n<p>Multi-access: Legwork is mostly in to help vs Cerebral Imaging combo-decks.  R&amp;D Interface\nis just standard for pressuring there.<\/p>\n\n<p>Crescentus: Seems like a good idea if you're forcing the corp to do all this rezing that\nyou can find a way to force them to do it more than once.  I'd like some recursion for \nthese but couldn't fit the Clone Chips in.<\/p>\n\n<p>Breakers:  Wigh these breakers you can pretty much ensure that you're opponent is going to\ngo crazy with remotes.  A single remote with a single slab of ICE over it makes it \nimpervious to this deck which could be rather brutal.  That said, lots of top-tier decks\ndon't want to use remotes and any clicks and ICE they use building remotes means fewer\nclicks and ICE they use stopping your central server romp.  I feel like maybe a single AI\nbreaker could be the way to go just to add a little extra umph.

Same Old Thing is basically there just for Scavenge.<\/p>\n\n<p>I picked Deep Red not so much for the memory, but because it allows to use Knight way more efficiently. Since I picked Magnum Opus as the main economy engine, I actually added a couple Akamatsu to allow some flexibility.<\/p>\n\n<p>Test Run and Self-modifying Code for faster setup of the Icebreakers, and Clone Chip for some extra recycle on-the-fly.<\/p>\n\n<p>Since I ended up playtesting against Jinteki and Weyland only, I removed the HQ focusing cards in favor of the usual R&amp;D Interface. I also swapped Plascrete Carapace with Public Sympathy which works nicely with Professional Contacts and can protect from any kind of damage. Three copies for faster draw, and because the incoming Punitive Counterstrike will definitely raise the threat.<\/p>\n\n<p>Lastly, I have 3 unspent influence points. I don't think I really need to spend them, also because I wouldn't know what to substitute, but... any suggestions?<\/p>\n\n<p>The deck does work exceptionally well.\nBetween Femme and Knight there's not much the Corp can do to keep you out.\nAlso, Femme bypasses the restriction posed by Unorthodox Predictions and works perfectly on Hadrian's Wall and Ice Wall, the only two pieces of ICE that could (easily) make Knight noneffective. Janus 1.0 and Wotan are much rarer, but Femme can take care of them too.<\/p>\n","username":"paddosan","cards":{"01026":3,"01033":1,"01038":2,"01044":2,"01050":3,"02047":2,"02050":3,"02107":2,"03034":3,"03035":1,"03038":3,"03040":3,"03046":2,"03049":2,"03052":3,"03053":3,"03054":2,"04042":3,"04043":3}},{"id":1252,"name":"Silhouette Lightning Attack","creation":"2014-01-04 15:51:39","description":"<p>Run like there is no tomorrow, pound HQ and Centrals, hope to win before it's too late...<\/p>\n\n<p>Do NOT run the server he scores his agendas, do NOT expose - rez ice on this server, if you score a one pointer Frame them and blackmail them hitting their scoring remote.<\/p>\n\n<p>I don't think it will work very good, but it is a fun archetype<\/p>\n","username":"Greek Geek","cards":{"01018":3,"01021":2,"01023":3,"01034":2,"01050":3,"01053":2,"02023":3,"02104":2,"03044":2,"03052":3,"04001":2,"04085":2,"04089":2,"05030":1,"05035":3,"05041":2,"05042":2,"05045":2}},{"id":1253,"name":"Boby F.

Reina discourages rezzing, but you get most out of your Compromised Employee when there is lots of rezzing.

Then you recur your Ash with Howards or Interns.<\/p>\n\n<p>Sundew is the star of this deck. Protect it early with a Chimera or leave it unprotected if the runner does not trash assets and it can proivide a truckload of money over the course of the game.<\/p>\n\n<p>Server Diagnostics also works fairly well in this deck as you can play it after you've protected your centrals and it will act like another Sundew. Just make sure you don't fall into the tempation and wait too long to install ICE if they are running. After 3 turns they've made their cost at least so if you need ICE and not money, play them.<\/p>\n\n<p>Closed Accounts might seem like a weird card in this deck, but it has caught a lot of players unaware, especially if they gathered a few tags from shadows before this hit the table.

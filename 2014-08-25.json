It began as a mill bomb deck with a ton of viruses and 3x Mass Install but that sort of gimmicky play wasn't reliable enough for competitive play and so I added better support and brought down the virus count to what this deck is simply named after: 21.<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Breaker Suite: I wrestled with this aspect of Noise for quite some time and after trials with Knights, Darwin, and D4vid I decided to go with the basic set up of Crypsis and Corroder. Knight is great for the early game and allows you access when you really need it but I found that it drained both my clicks and credits for runs that more than anything turned up nothing, not to mention takes up MU which can be troublesome at times when you want to drop a surprise parasite when Djinn isn't in play yet. Darwin synergizes with Cyberfeeder excellently but a well timed purge by the corp and well defended servers can set you back pretty badly and wastes all those free credits you could have used installing viruses or using Crypsis\/Corroder. There's also the Clone Chip + Parasite combo, I'll often chuck a Parasite willingly if I've got a CC installed to face check ICE and mill a card. Once they've rezzed the card you can determine whether it's better to just break through it or slap a Parasite on it., remember you can always get them back with Deja Vu! <\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>There's also Noise's style of running to take into consideration, he's usually either short on credits or clicks in some fashion to be using the typical \"run fast and run often\"  strategy. Instead I've found that making fewer runs with more impact more than made up for a traditional breaker suite and often lead to more agenda pulls, the trick is learning to identify the right moments to strike. A very key aspect of this is when they have face down cards installed on remotes that could be Jackson. If you've milled enough cards to make an archives run worth it and no face down cards installed (which is usually after they've spent a turn scoring) my turn usually goes with an Aesop's sell + Wyldside draw + virus install + virus install + archives run.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Jackson: This card is an obvious deterrent to this build but it can be worked around by forcing his usage early. While there are limited ways of knowing when they have one in hand you can almost guarantee that a face down install after a good turn of milling is a Jackson, or you should at least treat it as such. I often find that after milling enough agendas they'll voluntarily pop Jackson on their own turn to avoid the milling of over 3 agendas which is a great time to Djinn out a Medium and run the hell out of R&amp;D. Just keep an eye on the field and if at all possible run those Jacksons early enough to take them out of play in the late game where it really matters.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Wyldside: I had my doubts about this card simply because limiting my already precious clicks seemed like a waste but it really pulled it's weight in the tournament every single game. Vs Jinteki it was a godsend that basically saved me clicks drawing up after traps or scoring which is what I'd be doing anyway. As a draw engine vs the other decks it supplied a constant choice of fresh viruses to choose from every turn which was a welcomed sight to see especially when I'm digging for a cache or a missing component to my rig like Aesop's or Grimoire. All in all I'm glad I put it in to say the least and sure you lose a click every turn but without Knight wasting your clicks you basically save a click since I found myself drawing at least twice a turn when digging anyway.<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Hope this description has helped and happy milling to all you Anarchs out there!<\/p>\n","username":"skaterforsale","cards":{"01001":1,"01002":3,"01005":3,"01006":3,"01007":2,"01008":3,"01009":2,"01010":1,"01012":3,"01016":3,"01047":3,"01050":3,"01051":3,"02003":3,"02041":1,"03038":2,"04005":2,"06014":2,"06037":3}},{"id":8934,"name":"Professeur jou\u00e9 au championnat d'Allemagne","creation":"2014-08-25 10:37:30","description":"<p>Toujours des probl\u00e8mes d'\u00e9conomies !<\/p>\n","username":"Murloc","cards":{"01004":1,"01007":1,"01008":1,"01009":1,"01010":1,"01012":1,"01026":1,"01028":1,"01038":3,"01041":1,"01043":1,"01050":3,"02003":1,"02004":1,"02041":1,"02047":3,"02049":2,"02066":1,"02091":1,"03029":1,"03034":3,"03035":2,"03038":3,"03040":2,"03046":3,"03049":2,"03053":2,"04047":1,"04061":1,"04065":1,"06038":3}},{"id":8935,"name":"Whizzard: Consistent Gamer","creation":"2014-08-25 10:43:10","description":"<p>Or, What Does Everyone Have Against Djinn?<\/p>\n\n<h4>Influence<\/h4>\n\n<p>Anarchs need to get three things from out of faction: economy, draw, and tutors. Their in-faction options are either too expensive (Liberated Accounts) or come with drawbacks (Wyldside, Queen's Gambit). Thus, Easy Mark, Lucky Find, Express Delivery, and Special Order. Armitage, John Masanori, and Djinn are influence-free ways to shore up the three weak points, respectively.<\/p>\n\n<h4>Tag Me!<\/h4>\n\n<p>This deck really couldn't care less about tags. You're probably clicking Armitage as many times as possible on the turn you drop it, and you're probably using Same Old Thing right away too. This disregard for tags lets you use John M and Josh B to raise the tempo in the late game race to the finish. Just try to have a Plascrete down.<\/p>\n\n<h4>Playstyle<\/h4>\n\n<p>I find that when you're playing Anarch, the game is split in two: the part where you're building up and putting precise pressure on the corp; and the part where you're racing to the finish and want to do as much damage in as few turns as you can. If you've ever played a Noise Wyldside-Pawnshop deck, that switch is flipped on the turn you pawn Wyldside. In this deck, the switch is flipped when you use Josh B for the first time. If you can safely ignore the downside to his ability, you can get one of the strongest abilities in the game for one measly credit. And even one 5-click turn can blow a game wide open.<\/p>\n\n<p>Note that every program in this deck sans Djinn is tutorable. This frees up card slots for goodies like Demolition Run, Scrubbed, and recursion. Also, in regards to Djinn, if you think about it as a 2 MU chip stapled to a reusable Special Order, it doesn't seem quite as slow. Being able to pull Parasites on demand is slightly less cool than doing so at instant-speed, but you make do with what you have.<\/p>\n\n<h4>Goodies<\/h4>\n\n<p><a href=\"\/en\/card\/06034\">Scrubbed<\/a> is basically end-game economy combined with Datasucker token saving combined with a counter for your opponent's current. <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01003\">Demolition Run<\/a> plus Nerve Agent is the ticket for corps that like to keep operations hidden away in hand. <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01002\">D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu<\/a> lets you facecheck destroyers early on without fear, and if you don't need them for anything else, gives you extra Parasite uses.<\/p>\n\n<h4>Why no Sure Gamble?<\/h4>\n\n<p>Open the chart of what the cards in this deck cost. There's a grand total of 1 card in this deck that costs more than 3 credits, and that's the almighty Yog.0 (which shouldn't need to come out too often).

I ended up taking it to a tournament yesterday and only lost one game with it.  In that one game, I was sitting at 5 points with a scored Atlas counter when the Runner desperately installed Crypsis as his only breaker (after losing both of his Corroders in the first two turns and clicking for credits most of the game), then proceeded to run through Archer and Wall of Static for 14 credits to access one card and grabbed the only 3-pointer left in a 25-card R&amp;D for the win.  Doh!<\/p>\n\n<p>Anyway, this deck's goal is to kill the Runner's fracters, typically Corroder.  You install barriers everywhere, with some program destruction ice thrown in here and there.  Throw Will-o (which is not unique!) into the servers you think the Runner wants into the most to send their fracter to the bottom of the deck.  I often had Runners get cocky after seeing 5-6 barriers and no other ice, and start running servers without upgrades with impunity - typically leading to a fatal face-plant into Archer, Grim, or Ichi 2.0.  You also have Power Shutdown, which is particularly handy for wiping out Self-Modifying Code, Clone Chips, Inti, and Corroder.<\/p>\n\n<p>Parasite recursion decks can be a challenge, but the Power Shutdowns can take out a lot of their utility programs and Wraparound will prove a major obstacle for those decks.<\/p>\n\n<p>The Root is a fantastic card when it's up and running, but you want a light defense of it - throw a cheap barrier over it and save your better ice to secure a remote or central server.  You should have a ton of credits even without the Root, it's not critical to your economy here at all, though it does give it a nice boost.<\/p>\n\n<p>Interns is primarily there for Will-o, but I played a couple of mill decks and it was particularly effective in those games for retrieving milled agendas and putting them into a secure remote.  Jackson Howard is also a good Interns target when you need card draw and\/or have had multiple agendas milled into Archives.  Interns\/Jackson Howard are also effective at retrieving cards via self-inflicted wounds (Power Shutdown mills gone wrong).<\/p>\n\n<p>Subliminal Messaging is a very potent and profitable card here.  After the first Power Shutdown and\/or Will-o went off, Runners tended to sit back and turtle while they tried to find tools to deal with what I had going on.  In those circumstances, Subliminal became a free credit every turn.

Since Nasir was released, people have said it's an automatic 3-of, but in this deck, it's more just a bonus that you're happy to see when it pops up. That has so far been my, and I think everyone else's, biggest problem with Nasir: what to do when you don't see that Workshop. I now believe that with cheap breakers like Yog(asaurus, for best results) paired with early Datasucker support is the key to running as cheap as possible - Ghost Runner has made this all viable, and I will never run less than 3 copies in this deck. 3x Kati and 3x Dinosaurus are essential pieces of this deck that let Nasir play aggressive in the early game.

Sorry folks, but Nasir still needs money, and when the corp isn't feeding it to him, and Kati\/ProCo is your only the outside-the-run money, you tend to either stay pretty poor or spending several turns getting Kati ready for a play (not even a big play; just a play), at which points things have changed, windows have closed, and others have opened that you just can't prepare for.

Those dropped breakers also meant room for one more SMC, which should really help get the all important first Datasucker out as early as possible. Ideal situation of course is to not have to tutor for it, but if that's the case, then so be it.<\/p>\n\n<p>I love the direction this build is going, and I owe a big thanks to both CJFM and Krystman for their input. I still want to improve this though. If you see anything you think needs tweaking, please please please make suggestions! My thoughts right now are that this deck is at its absolute weakest when it doesn't see an early Kati Jones. The obvious solution is to swap the HQI's for Hostages to help with both Kati and ProCo, but I just don't know how I feel about that. Sure, Shapers traditionally aren't the \"HQ multi-access\" faction, but this deck feels dead in the water against an NEH or CI.

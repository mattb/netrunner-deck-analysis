Most of the time it was quite alright.

Quite often it is a Nisei Mk II but getting of the 3-pointers to close out the game or an NAPD for the same reason is more then just a little helpful.<\/p>\n\n<p>For ICE I went away from the rather typical Quandry as a cheap code gate. I wanted something with a little more bite. In the end I settled for Yagura and Enigma, because both force either a rather expensive Yog or provide a proper tax as the outer most piece of ICE of a central server.<\/p>\n\n<p>Cheap barriers, besides Eli, were another issue I had to address since Himitsu Baku really didn't work out as well as I liked. In the end I went for one Wraparound to force the fracter and a Wall of Static to provide a strength 3 ICE for Atman and an expensive barrier for Inti.<\/p>\n\n<p>In the sentry department I was rather unhappy with just Pup, Komainu and Tsurugi. I really wanted something that a Mimic or Femme couldn't handle as easily.

I'm still convinced that his deck is the best version of Anarch Siphon recursion currently out there. It's frustrating to play against. This version offers alternatives to the DLR\/Josh B. combo in Lamprey+SDB.  Any helpful feedback would be appreciated.<\/p>\n\n<p>Changes and rationale: Sneakdoor Beta + Lamprey, when you get it, can be brutal, and unexpected. Lamprey allows the runner to keep the corp poorer and still access from HQ, which is what you'll want to be doing midgame anyway. They further the plan. As an additional effect, the Corp can waste its turn and clear viruses to trash Lamprey, which is what I've found they do anyway with DLR or Josh B., so the tempo is largely the same. The only difference is that DLR when you're tagged is a LOT better. Lamprey doesn't necessitate an immediate answer, and they might leave it on the table longer.<\/p>\n\n<p>The 1-off Sneakdoor Beta is not an ideal inclusion. Wooley ran 1-off Indexing, which is superior for his build with DLR. Sneakdoor is expensive and Reina is usually poor. You're going to have to wait until you get a few siphons off to play it, if you do. Though it will force the corp to commit more to archives, leaving HQ and R&amp;D potentially more vulnerable.<\/p>\n\n<p>Cyber Threat is untested. With Rook, it has potential to open Sneakdoor\/Lamprey\/Siphon plays. The problem is that I'm not sure it's any better than just making a run blind. You can't SOT it either, which sucks. Seems really bad against NBN and Black Tree Jinteki.<\/p>\n\n<p>AoA is a very powerful archetype, and I'm hoping that Lamprey is a good inclusion. <\/p>\n\n<p>Other possible inclusions: <\/p>\n\n<p>Keyhole. Expensive, but excellent early. Necessitates a Corp reaction, or else they risk falling behind or just losing outright.<\/p>\n\n<p>A second Sneakdoor for a Siphon?

Note that this doesn't work with the Projects <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04010\">Ares<\/a> or <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02051\">Vitruvius<\/a>, because all advancement tokens are removed when you score them.<\/p>\n\n<p>Bifrost Array works decently well with most other HB agendas, but there's one that it's absolutely bonkers with: <a href=\"\/en\/card\/03005\">Efficiency Committee<\/a>. It'll be so good that I expect people to hit 21 agenda points when Bifrost comes out, just so they can run a third copy of it. And to showcase this, I present a 7-point, 1-turn combo in a deck that has none of Accelerated Diagnostics, Power Shutdown, or Jackson Howard.<\/p>\n\n<p>I also figured, since this is a deck that isn't gonna be buildable for the next 3 months, I might as well throw in a couple other unreleased cards.

But sometimes, flavor has to come before function.<\/p>\n\n<p>Note that this combo needs 3x <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01100\">Shipment from Kaguya<\/a> in hand. This is a difficult thing to accomplish. Do not blame me when the last one is at the bottom of your deck.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Disclaimer: This is for demonstration purposes only. Actually playing this deck is highly not recommended, unless you enjoy losing 90% or more of the time in order to hit a crazy combo once.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<hr \/>\n\n<h4>Requirements<\/h4>\n\n<h5>In Hand: 14 cards<\/h5>\n\n<ul>\n<li>2x Biotic Labor  <\/li>\n<li>2x Shipment from MirrorMorph<\/li>\n<li>1x Efficiency Committee  <\/li>\n<li>1x Bifrost Array  <\/li>\n<li>1x Director Haas  <\/li>\n<li>3x Shipment from Kaguya   <\/li>\n<li>2x 3\/2 agendas  <\/li>\n<li>1x Haas Arcology AI  <\/li>\n<li>1x Reclamation Order<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<h5>Credits: 18<\/h5>\n\n<h5>R&amp;D: Irrelevant<\/h5>\n\n<h5>Archives: Irrelevant<\/h5>\n\n<h5>In Play: Irrelevant<\/h5>\n\n<hr \/>\n\n<h4>The Combo<\/h4>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>2x <strong>Biotic Labor<\/strong><br \/>\n5 clicks remaining, 8 credits spent<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Shipment from Mirrormorph<\/strong><br \/>\nInstall Efficiency Committee, Bifrost Array, and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/03010\">Director Haas<\/a><br \/>\n4 clicks remaining, 9 credits spent<br \/>\n<em>Rez Director Haas<\/em><br \/>\n5 clicks remaining, 12 credits spent<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>2x <strong>Shipment from Kaguya<\/strong><br \/>\nAdvance Efficiency Committee and Bifrost Array<br \/>\n3 clicks remaining, 12 credits spent<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>2x <strong>Advance Efficiency Committee<\/strong><br \/>\n<em>Score Efficiency Committee<\/em><br \/>\nPlace 3x agenda counters on Efficiency Committee<br \/>\n1 click remaining, 14 credits spent<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>3x <strong>Use Efficiency Committee agenda counters<\/strong><br \/>\n4 clicks remaining, 14 credits spent<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Shipment from MirrorMorph<\/strong><br \/>\nInstall 2x 3\/2 agendas and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/03011\">Haas Arcology AI<\/a><br \/>\n3 clicks remaining, 15 credits spent<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Shipment from Kaguya<\/strong><br \/>\nAdvance Bifrost Array and Haas Arcology AI<br \/>\n<em>Score Bifrost Array<\/em><br \/>\nUse Bifrost Array to place 3x agenda counters on Efficiency Committee<br \/>\n2 clicks remaining, 15 credits spent<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>3x <strong>Use Efficiency Committee agenda counters<\/strong><br \/>\n5 clicks remaining, 15 credits spent<br \/>\n<em>Rez Haas Arcology AI<\/em><br \/>\n5 clicks remaining, 17 credits spent<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Use Haas Arcology AI advancement token<\/strong><br \/>\n6 clicks remaining, 17 credits spent<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Reclamation Order<\/strong><br \/>\nReclaim 3x Shipment from Kaguya<br \/>\n4 clicks remaining, 18 credits spent<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>3x <strong>Shipment from Kaguya<\/strong><br \/>\nAdvance 2x 3\/2 agenda<br \/>\n<em>Score 2x 3\/2 agenda<\/em><br \/>\n1 click left over, 18 credits spent, 7 agenda points scored<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<hr \/>\n\n<p>And there you have it.

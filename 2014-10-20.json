Midori can be used to bring in one of the two key pieces, usually I hold Cell Portal in hand and bring it in with Midori when I have a chance to infinite loop, replacing something like Pup or Tsurgi on the bottom of a server. Corporate Troubleshooter can be used to boost strength of whirlpool or Cell Portal. Install as many shadows as possible in the server using architect along with akitaro(if one was not installed already).. 2 Shadows and Akitaro net you 1 credit each loop assuming shadows are not broken. Architect can keep installing shadows and other cards to dig for shadows, remember you can use first subroutine to install an ice on a separate server trashing all of the ice in that server, use second sub to bring the shadow from archives to your loop server. Once you have infinite $, install a Junebug, and a Matrix Anaylzer, and advance it however many times you want. Finally install Bullfrog, and bring them over to your junebug.(runners can hold credits until this point technically, you can keep bidding 1, and they will eventually not be able to match and you can move them over to the Junebug)<\/p>\n\n<p>This deck is for fun of course, It's not meant to be a serious tournament deck.

If that's a <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04078\">Curtain Wall<\/a>, well, 14 credits is a <em>lot<\/em> of credits.  An early overscored Atlas is nice for that combo.<\/p>\n\n<p>You can also make some seriously towering glacier walls here.  Try getting past a Curtain and a Hadrian without D4V1d.  Quite costly.  (Speaking of which, I really need to play against some good Quetzal decks to see how it fares there.  Write me at BGG [same username] if you would kindly play me online.)<\/p>\n\n<h2>The Key Players<\/h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"\/en\/card\/06068\">Blue Sun<\/a> is amazing.  It combos very well with a lot of cards, and this deck is full of them.  The big ones:<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"\/en\/card\/06008\">The Root<\/a> and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02038\">Amazon Industrial Zone<\/a>.  They both do similar things for this build, and they work together to double the combo.  Install and rez a piece of ice for 3-6 cheaper than normal.  At the beginning of next turn, pull them back for the regular price.  Lots of money for cheap.  Then, when you don't need them anymore, Blue Sun them back (though the runner realizes the combo and goes for them - but if they went past a curtain wall to trash your AIZ and paid <em>how many credits<\/em>? You win either way).<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"\/en\/card\/02079\">Oversight AI<\/a> is obviously a key player.  It's in every <a href=\"\/en\/card\/06068\">Blue Sun<\/a> deck out there.  Rez a big piece of ice, like a Curtain Wall, for one credit, then gain X-1 credits at the beginning of next turn, plus the fact that that server was pretty well protected.  It doesn't work every time, especially against builds with D4V1d.  Similar combo happens with <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01106\">Priority Requisition<\/a>, but longer and less satisfying.<\/p>\n\n<p>All the ice do pretty rad things.  Of course, Hadrian and Curtain are the most exciting part of that, but <a href=\"\/en\/card\/06009\">Taurus<\/a>, <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01090\">Tollbooth<\/a>, and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02019\">Caduceus<\/a> are all really great.  Taurus and Caduceus don't combo as well with the AIZ\/Root combo, but if you can get the runner to run them, they can do some serious good.<\/p>\n\n<p>I haven't really seen too much use for <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04037\">Elizabeth Mills<\/a>, so I may drop her soon.  However, if I swap out anything for a grim or Geothermals, I'd like to have her around.  Very good combo that nobody realizes because, well, nobody remembers that she exists.  But remove bad pub, then put her back in hand and install again.<\/p>\n\n<p>Scoring an <a href=\"\/en\/card\/06030\">Eden Fragment<\/a> early on is awesome, because you can pull off the AIZ\/Root combo in a remote server while you build it up to be the big glacier you want.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Other things I'd consider<\/h2>\n\n<p>Don't forget to get rid of Caissa and Parasite cards with the ID ability. Trash those suckers.<\/p>\n\n<p>If I were you, making this deck, I might consider doing <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01070\">Snares<\/a> or <a href=\"\/en\/card\/05010\">Psychic Fields<\/a>.  Mid-game, you can install it, then reveal it and Blue Sun it.  It messes with the runner really bad.  Install it again, and reveal it again.  Do it again with an Atlas, and when they don't run it, advance it.  Vary the number of turns you use for this.  Also, this doesn't really work.  It's just fun.<\/p>\n\n<p>This deck could tire you out.  It takes a bit of thinking and a lot of basic arithmetic that could just get you a little worn out.  I might consider using something else if you're in a long tournament.  However, if it's not that long, I'd certainly take this.<\/p>\n\n<h3>The Record<\/h3>\n\n<p>2-0.  Easy wins so far.<\/p>\n\n<p>AP win vs. PPVP Kate - 7-2.  Big glacier wall involving Curtain, Eli, and Hadrian protecting my agendas, with 10 credits to spare.<\/p>\n\n<p>Flatline win vs. Caissa Reina - KILL-2.  I thought this might be a tough one, but he kept installing parasites, knights, and rooks.  D4V1D was pretty crazy.<\/p>\n\n<p>I'll keep updating this as it sees more play.<\/p>\n","username":"Friff14","cards":{"01086":2,"01090":2,"01094":3,"01099":3,"01102":2,"01106":1,"01110":3,"01111":2,"02018":3,"02019":3,"02038":2,"02079":3,"02110":2,"02117":1,"02120":1,"04015":2,"04037":2,"04040":3,"04078":2,"06008":3,"06009":2,"06030":1,"06068":1,"06071":1}},{"id":9965,"name":"ProgramSpam","creation":"2014-10-20 07:14:20","description":"\n","username":"bewnt","cards":{"01001":1,"01006":1,"01007":2,"01008":2,"01009":2,"01010":2,"01011":1,"01012":3,"01044":1,"02003":3,"02041":2,"02102":3,"03047":3,"04003":2,"04005":1,"04022":2,"04043":2,"04061":1,"05054":3,"06014":3,"06033":3,"06037":3}},{"id":9966,"name":"Bunker","creation":"2014-10-20 07:15:10","description":"\n","username":"allexx54","cards":{"01069":1,"01078":2,"01091":1,"01106":3,"01110":3,"02014":1,"02033":2,"02053":1,"02054":2,"02079":3,"03014":3,"03026":2,"04013":2,"04019":1,"04073":2,"04078":2,"04114":2,"04116":1,"05003":1,"05006":1,"05007":3,"05015":1,"05016":1,"05020":1,"05021":2,"05024":3,"06003":3,"06025":2}},{"id":9967,"name":"Weyland is Coming to Murder You","creation":"2014-10-20 08:24:42","description":"<p>This is the result of my experiment of trying to create a hyper-aggressive Weyland deck using Blue Sun.  It's not as crazy aggressive as I would prefer, but this is the deck that played the best so far using the cards I wanted to try out.  The Ice suite selected is a mix between good Weyland stop-in-your-tracks ice, as well as taxing ice, in order to bring the runner's money down and yours up.  There are multiple ways included to tag the runner as well, running two copies each of <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01086\">SEA Source<\/a>, <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01070\">Snare!<\/a>, <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01095\">Posted Bounty<\/a>, and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01104\">Shadow<\/a>.  <\/p>\n\n<p>As for playstyle, I'll often protect R&amp;D with a single <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01102\">Hadrian's Wall<\/a> or <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04078\">Curtain Wall<\/a> for much of the game, as it is often enough to deter the runner from wanting to get in due to the cost.  Fem and Parasite don't erode the walls either, due to Blue Sun's ability to suck the ice back to the hand to be re-played.  Also due to Blue Sun's ability, it is fairly easy to score early agendas, since you can rez ice to protect it (with ice like <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04117\">Hive<\/a> or <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01090\">Tollbooth<\/a>, ideally), bringing your money to zero if need be, then suck the ice back up and score the agenda out, making the server disappear.  A double over-advanced <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02018\">Project Atlas<\/a> in this deck oftentimes spells impending doom, as you can oftentimes set up lethal combos with <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01099\">Scorched Earth<\/a> or <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04079\">Punitive Counterstrike<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"\/en\/card\/06066\">Reversed Accounts<\/a> is a godsend in this deck, as it can either kill the runner's money by advancing it several times, then siphoning the runner's money away, or by tricking the runner into running on it, wasting his money getting through your server -- and at this point he is literally forced to trash it, otherwise losing not only the money spent breaking into the server, but also the 4 credits per advancement.  This can be used either to set up a scoring window to score a real agenda, or to lower the runner's money into a SEA -> Scorch combo.<\/p>\n\n<p>The card I'm on the fence about in this deck, though, is <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01104\">Shadow<\/a>.  Advancing it allows it to become taxing to the runner, but at the cost of wasting corp cash as well.  Also, if you advance it, it becomes a loss of both your time and money spent advancing to suck it back to your hand, giving some anti-synergy with the ID.  It gives another way to land a tag, and if un-advanced can be sucked back to the hand, making any new ice placed down have the threat of being able to give a tag, but at one strength any sentry breaker gets through it with relative ease, so simply doesn't pack much of a threat.  I'll most likely replace it, but I'm still playing around with what.<\/p>\n","username":"Saan","cards":{"01070":2,"01086":2,"01090":1,"01095":2,"01099":3,"01102":3,"01104":2,"01106":1,"01110":3,"02018":3,"02019":3,"02079":3,"03027":3,"04015":2,"04036":3,"04040":3,"04078":2,"04079":3,"04117":2,"06003":1,"06066":2,"06068":1}},{"id":9968,"name":"Fast advancing to the Sun!","creation":"2014-10-20 09:30:03","description":"<p>This is a really fun concept that I came up with.<\/p>\n\n<p>The idea is to utilize the Blue Sun ability, so you can go to 14c even from 0, at the start of your turn and Biotic labor the Agenda. <\/p>\n\n<p>3 Hostile Take-overs, 3 project atlas, posted bounties ... <\/p>\n\n<p>Reclamation order to pick up either Biotic Labor's or Oversight AI's ;) <\/p>\n\n<p>Of course, this is just the backbone of the idea.

The thing is, I've won 15\/16 with it. Because I'm sure so many builds are very similar, I'll just talk about the differences.<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>No Wyldside. I'm shopping but I still do not like the card. It costs me clicks. Yeah, you get a double draw...until you don't want it any more and are praying for a shop. Perhaps that's just my luck, but between Dijinn, the bursty draws of Diesel, and simply clicking, I always seem to get what I need.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Why Diesel? It's FREE. All econ arguments aside, it's still a burst of draw for nothing. Honestly just seeing one is perfect.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Mass Install is AMAZING. Mill 3 instantly, and God forbid it's more than one Cache, because here comes the run. I like to mulligan for it every now and again if I'm feeling extra saucy. I've had multiple occasions of first turn Mass, Cache, Cache, Lamprey. Then if they don't have HQ iced? Bye Bye 3 credits.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Lucky Find over Sure Gamble? Yep, though it's a double click it breaks one of the few rules I play by in this deck. I don't want to waste clicks or be forced into using them like Wyldside. The other rule I built by was keeping it cheap, and with the exception of Crypsis, everything costs 3 or less. The result is that I can keep credits and even after a closed accounts or simply an expensive run, I'm almost always right back into the green on credits.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Hemmorage over Nerve Agent? Originally I had it because I liked it, and I also thought against Jinteki it would be nice to have a tool to affect HQ safely. Aggressive running and trashing, coupled with Hemorrhage, wins games simply because there is a tipping point were the corp is force to draw far more just to keep critical cards in their hand.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Sometimes splashing a single card wins games. Every time I think I want to take out the lone Stimhack it pops up and becomes the key piece that wins me the game.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>No clone chip. Nope. Nada. Not what I'm trying to do. Yes, I know it's instant speed Parasite or Knight, and I love that idea, but more often than not I've hurt them enough with mills and trashing that standard parasites work just as well.<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>This deck rarely needs more than a single breaker. It's a question of aggression, something every Anarch player knows already. I just feel this build does it all a bit faster, cheaper, and recovers more quickly.<\/p>\n","username":"locusshifter","cards":{"01001":1,"01002":3,"01004":1,"01006":2,"01008":3,"01009":2,"01010":1,"01012":2,"01034":2,"01047":2,"01051":2,"02003":2,"02009":2,"03052":3,"04022":3,"04043":3,"04082":2,"04109":2,"05051":2,"06014":3,"06037":3}},{"id":9997,"name":"Mac's Big Rig ","creation":"2014-10-20 21:07:02","description":"\n","username":"obscurement","cards":{"01007":1,"01012":2,"01020":2,"01026":1,"01033":1,"01035":1,"01036":2,"01037":2,"01041":1,"01042":1,"01043":1,"01044":2,"01047":2,"01050":2,"01053":1,"02007":1,"02028":2,"02047":2,"02048":1,"02050":1,"02069":2,"02081":2,"03034":2,"03035":1,"03038":1,"03041":3,"03049":2,"03050":1,"03052":2,"04047":1,"06057":1,"06077":1}},{"id":9998,"name":"No Jacksons required","creation":"2014-10-20 21:07:10","description":"<p>Pretending that Jackson Howard didn't exist and going from there.

I think I've finally struck the correct balance, and it's now 6\/6.<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Enhanced Login Protocol. Good grief this card is good. Biotic ice went from passable with clicks to required to break plus clicks in most cases. <\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Heinlein Grid is the other piece of the ELP combo. With ELP out no one wants to click against Biotics at all. Mega economy drain commences immediately thereafter as they pay through the nose, and a double click, for that first run.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>54 cards??? Yep, and it's what inspired the name of the deck. One of the things I had always read, and agreed with, is that the Foundry destroys your R&amp;D. It does. I still measure how often I use its ability, especially with the double dip you get with Accelerated Beta Test. I average 5 uses of the Foundry's ability per game, which means I'm essentially playing a 49 card deck in short order.  Early on, since I'm only running 10 agendas, my R&amp;D is a touch less saturated, which is a double benefit.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>ABT + Foundry is AMAZING. Thanks Lukas.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>You'd think Peak Efficiency would be best, but over the course of the game the Subliminals pay out early and more often. <\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Biotic Labor, simply because I can, and it's winning games.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>A nice aside is that you can keep the runner poor enough that often you drop a NAPD in play and the runs are too expensive for them to steal it at that point. With the Biotics I've had people simply believe it's a Jackson, then I Biotic it FTW.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Architect is AMAZING. I think it's just great overall, but here, since I'm soaking clicks, I can surprise rez if they are running last click(s) and use it to install an agenda. That's sexy ice.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Hitting the right balance of economy and ice costs has been tough. I decided volume was better than size, and it's made the deck faster, more efficient, and more prolific with its ice.<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>This deck is a grind though, so sometimes it plays a bit longer than many might prefer, but you never feel out of control.  I'm still playing around with ice composition, and econ, so any suggestions are welcome.<\/p>\n","username":"locusshifter","cards":{"01055":3,"01058":2,"01059":3,"01061":2,"01062":2,"01110":3,"01111":2,"02019":2,"02051":3,"02056":2,"02070":3,"02110":2,"03026":2,"04015":3,"04090":2,"04096":2,"04100":3,"04119":2,"06003":2,"06021":1,"06022":3,"06023":2,"06030":1,"06061":2,"06071":1}},{"id":10001,"name":"Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle","creation":"2014-10-20 21:44:05","description":"\n","username":"scourged","cards":{"01058":2,"01059":3,"01086":1,"01099":2,"01106":1,"01110":3,"01113":2,"02051":1,"02110":3,"03001":1,"03005":3,"03017":3,"03019":2,"04034":3,"04040":3,"04072":2,"04090":3,"04100":1,"04111":3,"04119":3,"06041":2,"06070":2,"06071":1}},{"id":10002,"name":"My Superfriends","creation":"2014-10-20 21:59:17","description":"\n","username":"obscurement","cards":{"01054":1,"01055":3,"01056":3,"01061":2,"01064":2,"01109":2,"01110":3,"02012":1,"02013":2,"02029":3,"02051":3,"02092":3,"03004":1,"03010":2,"03015":1,"03017":2,"03018":1,"03019":2,"03020":2,"03023":1,"04060":2,"04077":2,"04113":1,"04114":2,"04119":3}},{"id":10003,"name":"Still Working to that Perfection Thing","creation":"2014-10-20 23:27:43","description":"<p>A copy of Striving for Perfection with an attempt to fit in newer cards.

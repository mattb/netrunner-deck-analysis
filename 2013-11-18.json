I would like to get 2-3 rabbit holes if my meta winds up having a lot of NBN and\/or trace. I'm not sure what to cut. Dinosaurus was a dead card in the tourney for me. I don't have the influence for another console. Constructive criticism welcome. Thanks.

I've stuck in 2 eschers, mostly to be sure you get it rather than losing it to damage, and to get it sooner. <br><br>I've added pro contacts (and 3 of them!) to facilitate draw and fuel the super cheap breaks.  I've removed sure gambles for daily casts and escher, since it feels redundant in mopus decks for me.  Casts however, will save you clicks, which you can now use to dig AND gain money.<br><br>I have addressed those MU issues people were complaining about with the best possible method, akamatsus.  Sure omnidrive is up for discussion, but I feel like 3 is too much for it, and it'll take a lot longer to catch up to the opportunity cost of 3 and 1 click (which is worth 2c with mopus out, or 1c and 1 card with contacts).<br><br>Let me know what you think of the changes.","username":"x3r0h0ur","cards":{"01008":2,"01010":1,"01012":1,"01014":1,"01026":2,"01036":2,"01037":3,"01038":3,"01044":2,"02009":2,"02047":2,"02048":3,"02107":3,"03028":1,"03031":2,"03034":2,"03038":3,"03040":3,"03046":3,"03049":3,"03053":2}}]
